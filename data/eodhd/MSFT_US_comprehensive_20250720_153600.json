        "title": "Buy Microsoft Stock Now, or Wait for a Pullback?",
        "content": "Key Points\n\nRevenue growth accelerated in the company's most recently reported quarter. Microsoft is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings later this month. The company pays a dividend, which should grow on an annual basis for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than Microsoft \u203a\n\nAhead of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) quarterly earnings release on July 30, many investors are likely looking closely at their shares of the software giant. After all, the stock has seen an incredible run recently. Shares are up 42% from April 21 to July 17. Not only has the stock benefited from a sharp V-shaped recovery following a tariff-related sell-off that impacted much of the market, but it has also risen to a new all-time high. The problem? The valuation is now questionably rich.\n\nTo the company's credit, it's seeing impressive business momentum. Revenue and profit are both rising at double-digit rates, and the company appears well positioned to benefit from tailwinds in artificial intelligence (AI) -- both in terms of increased demand for its AI-related services and cost efficiencies as AI boosts employee productivity.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nBut the big question is whether the stock has risen too far, too fast. Clearly, the company has great momentum. But has a sky-high valuation already priced in the bull case for this stock?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAccelerating growth\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal third-quarter results from late April (its most recently reported quarter) capture how well the company is doing -- and why investors are bidding shares higher. Revenue rose 13% year over year -- an acceleration from 12% growth in fiscal Q2. Notably, when adjusting for foreign exchange, fiscal third-quarter revenue actually rose 15% year over year. Additionally, operating income grew even faster, rising 16%, or 19% in constant currency.\n\n\"Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings release. \"From AI infra and platforms to apps, we are innovating across the stack to deliver for our customers.\"\n\nDriving the quarter's results was a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue from the company's intelligent cloud segment. Included in this segment is the company's cloud-computing business, Azure. The cloud-powering infrastructure systems and software segment contributed 33% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nBut slower-growing segments still did well. For instance, Microsoft's revenue from its productivity and business processes segment rose 10% year over year, helped by growing Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\n\nHigh expectations\n\nSuch broad-based strength, driven by lucrative software and services, makes a compelling case for the company's long-term growth potential. But with shares now trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 40, is the valuation simply too high?\n\nGiven the stock's recent run-up, investors shouldn't get too excited. On the one hand, Microsoft's balanced business clearly deserves a high valuation multiple. After all, the company has a healthy balance sheet, a strong suite of products, and is seeing double-digit top- and bottom-line growth. However, a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 seems to price in plenty of optimism.\n\nAltogether, I'd lean more toward calling the stock a hold instead of a buy at the stock's current price. One reason I'm comfortable with this view, despite the stock's high valuation, is that the company takes some risk off the table every quarter by paying investors a quarterly dividend.\n\nMicrosoft is a great dividend stock.

        "content": "Key Points\n\nRevenue growth accelerated in the company's most recently reported quarter. Microsoft is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings later this month. The company pays a dividend, which should grow on an annual basis for the foreseeable future. 10 stocks we like better than Microsoft \u203a\n\nAhead of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) quarterly earnings release on July 30, many investors are likely looking closely at their shares of the software giant. After all, the stock has seen an incredible run recently. Shares are up 42% from April 21 to July 17. Not only has the stock benefited from a sharp V-shaped recovery following a tariff-related sell-off that impacted much of the market, but it has also risen to a new all-time high. The problem? The valuation is now questionably rich.\n\nTo the company's credit, it's seeing impressive business momentum. Revenue and profit are both rising at double-digit rates, and the company appears well positioned to benefit from tailwinds in artificial intelligence (AI) -- both in terms of increased demand for its AI-related services and cost efficiencies as AI boosts employee productivity.\n\nBut the big question is whether the stock has risen too far, too fast. Clearly, the company has great momentum. But has a sky-high valuation already priced in the bull case for this stock?Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccelerating growth\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal third-quarter results from late April (its most recently reported quarter) capture how well the company is doing -- and why investors are bidding shares higher. Revenue rose 13% year over year -- an acceleration from 12% growth in fiscal Q2. Notably, when adjusting for foreign exchange, fiscal third-quarter revenue actually rose 15% year over year. Additionally, operating income grew even faster, rising 16%, or 19% in constant currency.\n\n\"Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings release. \"From AI infra and platforms to apps, we are innovating across the stack to deliver for our customers.\"\n\nDriving the quarter's results was a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue from the company's intelligent cloud segment. Included in this segment is the company's cloud-computing business, Azure. The cloud-powering infrastructure systems and software segment contributed 33% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nBut slower-growing segments still did well. For instance, Microsoft's revenue from its productivity and business processes segment rose 10% year over year, helped by growing Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHigh expectations\n\nSuch broad-based strength, driven by lucrative software and services, makes a compelling case for the company's long-term growth potential. But with shares now trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 40, is the valuation simply too high?\n\nGiven the stock's recent run-up, investors shouldn't get too excited. On the one hand, Microsoft's balanced business clearly deserves a high valuation multiple. After all, the company has a healthy balance sheet, a strong suite of products, and is seeing double-digit top- and bottom-line growth. However, a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 seems to price in plenty of optimism.\n\nAltogether, I'd lean more toward calling the stock a hold instead of a buy at the stock's current price. One reason I'm comfortable with this view, despite the stock's high valuation, is that the company takes some risk off the table every quarter by paying investors a quarterly dividend.\n\nMicrosoft is a great dividend stock. Though its dividend yield is just 0.7%, there's plenty of room for this dividend payment to grow over time. This is evident by the fact that the company is paying out less than 25% of its earnings in dividends. Additionally, if history is any indication of the future, more dividend increases are likely.

Kianni had already gone viral during the pandemic by founding Climate Cardinals, a nonprofit that translated climate resources into over 100 languages. Gates, daughter of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, had interned at British Vogue and was passionate about sustainable fashion, Forbes says.\n\nTheir original concept was a browser extension that made it easier to shop secondhand, inspired by the clunky user experience they'd encountered, Kianni told Forbes.

        "title": "After Plummeting Over $1 Trillion in Value, This Super Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Mounting a Major Comeback, With Analysts Predicting Gains of Up to 400%",
        "content": "Key Points\n\nNvidia stock took a nosedive earlier this year thanks to concerns over tariffs and competition in China. These fears have subsided over the last couple of months, and positive investor sentiment has fueled Nvidia stock to new highs. Some on Wall Street think the Nvidia train can keep moving, potentially reaching a $20 trillion valuation over the next five years. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nFor a few years now, the artificial intelligence (AI) movement has largely hinged on the performance of a single company: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nSure, if Microsoft or Amazon posted strong results from their respective cloud computing platforms or if Tesla managed to hype investors up over the prospects of self-driving robotaxis or humanoid robots, the technology sector might see a fleeting upward movement. At the end of the day, however, the focus seemed to eventually return to Nvidia -- with analysts obsessing over how demand for the company's chips and data center services were trending.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, Nvidia's ship was caught in an epic storm. Investors started to question the company's long-growth prospects -- inspiring prolonged periods of panic-selling in the process. All told, Nvidia's market cap dropped by more than $1 trillion.\n\nBut now, with a market value north of $4 trillion, Nvidia has reclaimed its position as the most valuable company on the planet. Even better? Some on Wall Street are calling for further gains of up to 400%.\n\nLet's explore the tailwinds supporting Nvidia's long-term growth narrative and detail why Wall Street sees such massive upside for the king of the chip realm.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst is calling for a $10 trillion valuation for Nvidia\n\nOne of the most bullish Nvidia analysts on Wall Street is the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Kindig suggested that Nvidia could reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030 -- implying 140% upside from current levels. Let's explore the main catalysts supporting Kindig's forecast.\n\nAccording to management from Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, roughly $260 billion will be spent in 2025 alone on AI infrastructure. On top of that, Meta Platforms is expected to spend roughly $70 billion on capital expenditures this year -- nearly double what it spent in 2024. Lastly, Oracle is beginning to make significant headway in infrastructure services -- allowing companies to rent Nvidia GPUs from their cloud-based data center platform. From a macro perspective, rising capex from the cloud hyperscalers bodes well for chip demand.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKindig takes these secular tailwinds one step further, suggesting that competition from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices does not pose much of a threat to Nvidia's dominance. While it's hard to know how vendor preferences could change over the next several years, current industry research trends suggest that Kindig might be right -- underscored by Nvidia's rising market share in the AI accelerator industry.\n\nThe area of Kindig's analysis that I think is currently overlooked the most revolves around Nvidia's software architecture, called CUDA. Since CUDA is integrated tightly with Nvidia's hardware, developers essentially become locked into the company's ecosystem.\n\nNot only does this lead to customer stickiness, but it opens the door for Nvidia to be at the forefront of more sophisticated, evolving AI applications in areas such as robotics and autonomous driving.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat about $20 trillion?\n\nFormer management consulting executive Phil Panaro is even more bullish than Kindig. By 2030, Panaro thinks Nvidia's share price could reach $800 -- implying roughly a $20 trillion market cap.\n\nPanaro cites opportunities across Web3 development and evolving use cases around how enterprises and governments leverage AI to generate more efficiency and cost savings as the main pillars supporting Nvidia's upside.\n\nWhile these trends could eventually drive significant demand for Nvidia's data center services, tech adoption within the government tends to move slowly. Meanwhile, Web3 remains an emerging concept that could take far longer to mature than Panaro is assuming.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\n\nNvidia stock has been mounting an epic comeback over the last couple of months. This valuation expansion can be easily seen through the dynamics of the company's rising forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. Nevertheless, Nvidia's forward P/E of 40 is still well below levels seen earlier this year.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nTrying to model Nvidia's peak valuation is an exercise in false precision. The bigger takeaway is that analysts on Wall Street are not only calling for significant upside in the stock, but they have outlined the foundation for Nvidia's long-term growth. The important theme here is that Nvidia has opportunities well beyond selling chips -- many of which have yet to make meaningful contributions to the business.\n\nI see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer. Investors with a long-run time horizon might consider scooping shares up at current prices and plan to hold on for years to come.\n\nShould you buy stock in\u00a0Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The firm said it sees too many negative catalysts and that Coreweave could be in big trouble soon.\n\nAccording to analyst Abhishek Shukla, Coreweave\u2019s revenue comes from only a few customers that also use their own software. This has been diluting its \u201cvalue proposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoreWeave\u2019s key customers, namely Microsoft, Open AI, and Nvidia, do not use CoreWeave\u2019s software services, according to SemiAnalysis,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cWe believe this diminishes the competitive advantage and customer lock-in CoreWeave gets from its unique offering. In 1Q25, 72% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue came from Microsoft.

Coreweave is also suffering from higher borrowing costs, low asset turnover, and anticipated high capital expenditure costs due to the short shelf life of graphic processing units.\n\n\u201cAssuming that GPUs will need to be replaced after 6-7 years of use, the result would be high capex simply to maintain steady-state revenue beyond 2030e,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThe continued high capex requirement well beyond the high-growth phase of the company is one of the key reasons behind our low [discounted cash flow] valuation of CoreWeave.\u201dCoreWeave (CRWV) Stock Downgraded: HSBC Flags Liquidity Strains, Heavy Capex Ahead\n\nThe firm also warned that Coreweave\u2019s liquidity looks \u201cstretched.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to consensus for a steep decrease, we expect CRWV\u2019 s blended average interest rate to remain elevated. As it diversifies into customers with lower credit ratings than Microsoft (impacts borrowing cost) and we believe Open AI has not extended a material cash advance despite committing to USD15bn-plus of offtake, CoreWeave\u2019s liquidity looks stretched.\u201d\n\nCoreWeave, Inc.

        "title": "Trump's antitrust cops are OK with new mergers. Old tech monopolies, not so much.",
        "content": "President Trump's antitrust cops are friendlier thus far about mergers than their predecessors, but they are refusing to let up on one prominent priority of the Biden administration: monopoly prosecutions of the nation's best-known tech giants.\n\nSix months into Trump\u2019s second term in office, his antitrust regulators have already given the green light to more than 100 merger transactions, feeding the optimism of Wall Street bankers that new dealmaking will have widespread support in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn June, antitrust enforcers gave a go-ahead to three deals worth a combined $63 billion, including candy giant Mars\u2019 $36 billion takeover of Kellanova (K), and the DOJ announced a settlement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) allowing it to acquire software developer Juniper.\n\nThis month, the DOJ announced that it closed a major investigation into telecom giant T-Mobile's (TMUS) $4 billion acquisition of USCellular assets that allowed the tie up to proceed.A T-Mobile store in San Diego, Calif. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Carter via Getty Images\n\nAdministration officials claim the approvals are not a free pass because many have required pre-merger divestments or licensing requirements.\n\nYet at the same time, Trump's DOJ and FTC have shown no plans to relent in a series of high-stakes government prosecutions targeting the competitive tactics of Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL).\n\nNor have they shown any signs of unwinding investigations into Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).\n\nThat's despite efforts by the CEOs of these companies to curry favor with Trump, with many showing up in person for the president's inauguration in January. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried unsuccessfully this spring to stop a government trial against his company from going forward.\n\n\u201cThe criticism coming into this administration is that all of these Big Tech CEOs that were at the inauguration were going to get sweetheart deals; that they were going to settle these cases for pennies on the dollar,\" said Slade Bond, former principal deputy assistant attorney general in the Biden administration's Office of Legislative Affairs.Guests including Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk attended the Inauguration of Donald J. Trump in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 20. (Julia Demaree Nikhinson - Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\n\"And that just hasn't happened.\"\n\nThe Trump approach to new mergers, however, is \"different,\" Bond said, explaining that Trump\u2019s regulators have made it clear that they're more open to structuring deals in a way that Biden's DOJ antitrust head Jonathan Kanter and former FTC chair Lina Khan were not.\n\nArnold & Porter said the latest approvals clearly demonstrate the administration\u2019s willingness to negotiate.\n\nThe approach with mergers is \"a noteworthy shift away from the prior administration,\" according to a recent note published by the Washington D.C.-based law firm.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd the shift demonstrates the administration\u2019s willingness to negotiate, it added. \"FTC and DOJ Antitrust leadership resisted pre-litigation merger settlements during the Biden administration, choosing to litigate to challenge deals instead of accepting remedies.\"\n\nBut \"the new Trump administration leadership appears willing to accept divestitures to resolve its competitive concerns, providing an opportunity for merging parties to avoid litigation to get deals done.\"\n\n'The world knows we\u2019re going to be very serious'\n\nThe more flexible approach to mergers is not stopping Trump's enforcers from pressing ahead with dozens of prosecutions and investigations into the ways that dominant Big Tech companies are hanging onto their market power.\n\nThe DOJ, along with a group of US states, is waiting for judges to rule on their requests to force Google to break up its empire, after prevailing in two landmark cases against Google in 2024 and April this year.\n\nIn each case \u2014 one filed during Trump\u2019s first term in office and one brought by the Biden administration \u2014 the DOJ and states have pushed for remedies that would remake Google\u2019s search engine and online advertising empires.\n\nIn another ongoing case that Trump's FTC took to trial against Meta in April, regulators are awaiting a California federal judge's decision on their claims that the social media titan leveraged its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to box out competitors.\n\nAmazon and Apple are also in the new administration's antitrust crosshairs.Apple CEO Tim Cook seen behind US President Donald Trump and US Vice President JD Vance after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. (Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nIn two federal lawsuits brought by the Biden administration and inherited by Trump's FTC, regulators allege that Amazon illegally maintained its monopoly in the markets for online superstores and online marketplace services, and deceived customers into renewing Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nBiden\u2019s DOJ accused Apple of violating antitrust laws in an ongoing federal case in New Jersey, now under the direction of Trump's DOJ. The complaint alleges that the iPhone maker abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nOne top Trump antitrust official, Roger Alford, said in May that Trump's regulators were focused on prosecuting anticompetitive behavior that impacts everyday Americans.\n\nIn addition to the cases against Big Tech, he applauded Biden-era antitrust lawsuits filed against private equity firm Thoma Bravo's real estate management software developer RealPage and event promoter and ticket distributor Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster (LIV).\n\nAlford said to expect the administration's regulators to focus on protecting competition in markets where average Americans spend their money, like housing, transportation, insurance, and entertainment.\n\n\"So bring cases in those kinds of categories,\" he said. \"I think the world knows we\u2019re going to be very serious about antitrust enforcement.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Here are some of the major calls for the week:\n\nPROCTER & GAMBLE DOWNGRADED AHEAD OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\n\nEvercore lowered [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467079-procter-gamble-slips-after-evercore-isi-downgrades-and-warns-on-amazon-headwind] rating on Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG]) to In Line from Outperform ahead of the consumer product giant's Q4 earnings report.\n\nThe firm expects Procter & Gamble to issue guidance for 1% to 3% organic sales growth for F2026, including ~50 basis points of attrition from portfolio rationalization, not divestitures.\n\n\"Expect a F2026 outlook with a low but broad range of scenarios to be discussed on July 29 in conjunction with the 4Q release. Macro pressures are transient, and unlike prior downturns, Procter\u2019s portfolio now extends into mid-tier flanker brands in its price-sensitive categories, offering alternatives to pressured consumers,\" said analyst Robert Ottenstein.\n\nPALANTIR UPGRADED BY MIZUHO ON STRONG REVENUE GROWTH\n\nPalantir (NASDAQ:PLTR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR]) was upgraded [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467903-palantir-receives-upgrade-as-revenue-growth-remains-stunning-mizuho] to Neutral from Underperform by Mizuho Securities as its sustained revenue growth has proven to be stronger than expected and has changed the minds of doubters.\n\n\"We also believe PLTR has a legitimate chance to accelerate revenue growth for a 5th consecutive quarter when reporting 2Q results in early August,\u201d Mizuho said and increased PT to $135 from $116. The brokerage said PLTR appears very well-positioned to benefit from long-term trends in AI, government digital transformation, and industrial modernization.\n\nPalantir is scheduled to release its second quarter fiscal 2025 results on August 4.\n\nMORGAN STANLEY DOWNGRADES CROWDSTRIKE ON VALUATION\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467089-crowdstrike-dips-after-morgan-stanley-downgrades-on-valuation] CrowdStrike to Equal-weight from Overweight, with analysts led by Keith Weiss said they were \"stepping to the sidelines given full valuation after ~50% run and rising growth expectations.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that CrowdStrike is still a compelling long-term story, but the second half acceleration they expect now looks well priced in the shares.\n\nThe firm raised PT on the stock to $495 from $490 as they are positive on the longer-term growth potential, with a more balanced risk/reward they are moving to the sidelines awaiting better entry points to build positions.\n\nSHOPIFY ATTRACTS NEW BULL RATING AS NEEDHAM\n\nNeedham initiated coverage [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467097-shopify-attracts-a-new-bull-rating-as-needham-points-to-durable-growth-opportunity] on Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP]) with a Buy rating as the firm believes the company remains in only the mid-cycle of a durable growth opportunity, with significant recent investments in international and B2B strategies seen as the most exciting of the company's new growth drivers.\n\nNeedham's price target of $135 is based off a 26.6X EV/FY26 gross profit multiple.\n\n\"We are a touch cautious on the current domestic consumer, but consumer spending remains strong and the recent US tax bill can spur near-term consumer spend that can positively impact SHOP's GMV,\u201d Needham said.\n\nBofA Securities downgraded [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468028-ardent-health-trades-lower-as-bofa-securities-downgrades] ARDENT HEALTH (NYSE:ARDT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARDT]) to Underperform from Neutral, and reduced the price target to $14.60 from $15.50 as the investment bank sees increasing headwinds from cuts to Medicaid and ACA exchanges within the recently passed Reconciliation Bill.\n\nThere were also some PT changes this week on megacap companies.\n\nNeedham raised [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467820-nvidias-price-target-raised-at-needham-after-h20-chips-set-to-see-china-sales] its PT on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]) to $200 from $160 after the company announced that it hopes to resume sales of its H20 chips to China, citing U.S. government assurances that export licenses will be granted.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "I'm sure most avid basketball fans can remember when \"AI\" was used to describe NBA great Allen Iverson. Nowadays, when you hear AI, the first thing many people think about is artificial intelligence (AI). It makes sense, too, when you consider just how prominent AI-related news has been over the past couple of years.\n\nAI has been around for a while, but recent developments and the success of generative AI applications like ChatGPT have brought it to the forefront of many businesses. Because of this, there's been a surge in many stocks dealing with AI in virtually any capacity.\n\nAI is transforming industries, and investors looking to get in on the action should consider the following two stocks. Investing $1,500 in each will give investors great growth potential, as well as dividend income -- a true two for the price of one.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nFrom the outside looking in, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) may not seem like an AI stock, but its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any company right now.\n\nIf you read the last part of the last sentence and thought, \"Even more important than Nvidia?\" -- the answer may surprise you. Nvidia has been the stock market's biggest story for the past year or so, largely because of the importance of its graphic processing units (GPUs) to data centers used to train AI.\n\nNvidia's GPUs, however, heavily rely on the semiconductors that TSMC manufactures. As the world's leading semiconductor foundry, TSMC arguably produces the best semiconductors globally, attracting many top tech clients. Without the company's semiconductors, it's safe to assume that the quality of Nvidia's GPUs (and many other electronics) would suffer, causing a quality drop chain reaction.\n\nThe demand for TSMC's semiconductors should grow for the foreseeable future and continue the positive momentum the company's financials picked up since suffering from a slowdown in smartphone sales. Its second-quarter (Q2) revenue increased nearly 33% year over year and 10% from Q1.\n\nTSM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nFor a while, smartphone-related semiconductor sales were the bulk of TSMC's revenue, but in this past quarter, high-power computing (which includes AI-related chips) accounted for 52% of its revenue -- up from 24% in Q1.\n\nTSMC may encounter some geopolitical issues -- such as export restrictions -- but the company's long-term positioning remains strong. Its dividend yield of about 1.2% is also on par with the S&P 500's, incentivizing investors to remain patient as it potentially works through those roadblocks.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is an interesting AI play because of its partnership with ChatGPT's creator, OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions in OpenAI to help speed up its AI research and development, and the relationship has since become mutually beneficial. OpenAI uses the company's cloud platform Azure for its supercomputing power and infrastructure to train and run its AI models. In return, Microsft gets to deploy OpenAI's models in its suite of consumer and enterprise products.\n\nMicrosoft's portfolio of products -- including its Office software like Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Teams -- is already one of the most used in the world, and this OpenAI integration has strengthened user experience and capabilities. You'd also have to think it's partly responsible for Office 365's 15% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nIn Q3 of its fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue grew 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, led by its \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment, which includes Azure's business.\n\nMSFT Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft's intelligent cloud segment generated $26.7 billion in revenue, up 21% year over year, and Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure lags behind Amazon Web Service (AWS) in market share -- 25% to AWS' 31% -- but has been making positive strides that should continue with new AI integrations.\n\nAs part of the partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft released Azure OpenAI, which gives customers Azure's computing and security capabilities while running all of OpenAI's models. In the competitive cloud computing industry, offering an essential one-stop shop is an advantage, and this partnership puts Microsoft on track to do that and gain ground on AWS.\n\nMicrosoft's dividend yield is less than 1%, so it's far from ideal for income-seeking investors. However, the payout is an added benefit to a stock with a price that has risen by more than 50% in the past 12 months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nBank of America hikes Microsoft PT ahead of earnings\n\nBank of America (BofA) this week raised its price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $585 from $515 ahead of the company\u2019s July 30 earnings release, flagging strong momentum in cloud infrastructure, encouraging partner feedback, and early signs of traction from its AI Copilot tools.\n\nBofA said partner checks indicate deal activity in the fourth quarter was \u201clargely in line\u201d with Q3, supporting a \u201c0-1% upside\u201d to its $73.7 billion revenue estimate. Azure is expected to grow 35.5% year-over-year in constant currency, with \u201c18.0% points from AI,\u201d driven by cloud migrations and demand in security and data analytics.\n\nThe bank sees Microsoft\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes segment growing 13% in constant currency, slightly above its base case. \u201cPartner feedback suggests stable E3/E5 upgrade activity and ramping Copilot adoption,\u201d it noted.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, BofA models 3.4% growth, aided by stronger PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead, the firm expects 14% revenue growth in fiscal 2026, matching fiscal 2025. While its 45.5% margin forecast could face pressure from higher capital spending, BofA analysts said capex should remain \u201clargely consistent as a % of revenue at 31%.\u201d\n\nCalling Microsoft its \u201ctop pick,\u201d the analysts said the next catalyst could be \u201cmore evidence that Copilot is becoming more material to growth.\u201d Despite a 30% rally since Q3, they see more upside as Azure and AI continue to gain ground.\n\nGolden era of AI is just starting, analyst says\n\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping the tech sector, and its impact is still in the early stages, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives.\n\nIn a note Friday, Ives predicted a strong second half of 2025 for tech stocks, supported by a \u201cvery strong 2Q tech earnings season\u201d and growing AI tailwinds across chips, software, and enterprise applications.\n\n\u201cWe have barely scratched the surface of this 4th Industrial Revolution,\u201d he wrote, calling it a \u201cgolden age\u201d for technology.\n\nThe analysts estimate $2 trillion in AI-related spending from enterprises and governments over the next three years. \u201cThe Street is underestimating the underlying AI-driven growth ahead,\u201d they said, noting that \u201cuse cases are exploding\u201d as companies scale up adoption.\n\nGenerative AI is moving into a consumption phase, which Wedbush sees as a major catalyst for software. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) were listed as the firm\u2019s top tech picks for the remainder of the year.\n\nDespite ongoing geopolitical risks and tariffs, the analysts expect a favorable policy environment. \u201cThe Trump Administration will continue to soften its stance around tariffs,\u201d they wrote, pointing to Nvidia\u2019s return to selling H20 chips in China as a \u201ckey strategic positive.\u201d\n\nWedbush also highlighted AI\u2019s broad ripple effect across the sector. \u201cFor every $1 spent with Nvidia, we estimate the multiplier is another $8 to $10 spent throughout the rest of the tech ecosystem,\u201d the note said.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs more AI to sell more hardware: HSBC\n\nApple\u2019s push to boost iPhone upgrades through AI has yet to gain traction, according to HSBC analysts, who argue the company needs a more compelling AI offering to revive demand.\n\n\u201cThe iPhone still represents about half of Apple\u2019s sales,\u201d the bank wrote, but \u201cinitial hopes that AI would accelerate the renewal cycle have been short-lived.\u201d\n\nHSBC said Apple Intelligence, announced in June 2024 and rolling out through April 2025, has \u201cso far failed to trigger significant improvement in user experience.\u201d\n\nThe delayed launch of AI-powered Siri may also cause users to hold off on upgrading, the analysts warned. In the meantime, Apple will have to rely on standard hardware improvements.\n\n\u201cBetter specs with iPhone 17 in September should entertain the demand, in-line with what has been seen with the iPhone 16,\u201d HSBC noted, assuming tariffs don\u2019t push prices significantly higher.\n\nTrade concerns remain a key overhang. The investment bank said Apple \u201ccannot re-localise production fast enough to avoid U.S. tariff hikes,\u201d and pointed out that market forecasts now assume a 20% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nApple has already guided to a $900 million margin impact for the June quarter, though HSBC still expects the company to generate more than $100 billion in annual free cash flow.\n\nBeyond trade, regulatory pressures are also building. The European Commission is probing Apple for potential Digital Markets Act violations, while a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit introduces \u201clong-term risk to the business model,\u201d the bank said.\n\nHSBC kept a Hold rating and a $220 price target, citing a \u201c5% regulatory discount\u201d and cautioning that legal and tariff risks may limit near-term upside.\n\nTesla shares may outperform after Q2 results, Barclays says\n\nTesla shares may outperform following second-quarter results despite deteriorating fundamentals, according to Barclays. In a recent note, the bank called the setup \u201cconfusing\u201d but acknowledged upside potential, driven by investor focus on the company\u2019s long-term autonomous vehicle strategy.\n\n\u201cWe see potential for the stock to outperform,\u201d analysts wrote, pointing to expectations that the earnings call could spotlight Tesla\u2019s robotaxi ambitions. \u201cThe earnings call also presents an opportunity for Tesla\u2019s robotaxi/AV narrative to shine,\u201d they said, adding that Elon Musk may discuss fleet growth or expansion plans.\n\nBarclays expects a modest sequential improvement in auto gross margin excluding regulatory credits, though it warned margins will \u201clikely remain depressed vs prior years.\u201d\n\nThe bank also anticipates a 10% decline in 2025 vehicle deliveries, noting that consensus earnings forecasts have been sharply cut. \u201cWhereas \u201925 consensus EPS was over $3.20 into the beginning of the year, it is now down to $1.84,\u201d the note said.\n\nThe expected delay of Tesla\u2019s low-cost model could further pressure sentiment. Barclays believes Tesla may prioritize a third-quarter pre-buy ahead of the September 30 expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, potentially pushing the launch of the cheaper vehicle into the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cTesla likely to focus on a 3Q pre-buy...which could be perceived negatively,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nStill, Barclays argues that optimism around autonomous vehicles could outweigh weaker near-term fundamentals.\n\nIntel stock could squeeze higher during earnings\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares may be set for a short-term rally into earnings season, according to Citi, which sees potential for an upside surprise that could trigger a squeeze. Despite being one of the most shorted names in the sector, the bank believes improving fundamentals could shift sentiment.\n\n\u201cIntel remains the most popular short but we believe the stock could squeeze higher during earnings given potential upside to EPS,\u201d analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a Friday note.\n\nCiti pointed to lower capital expenditure and operating expenses, along with possible strength in the PC market\u2014which accounts for 60% of Intel\u2019s revenue\u2014as key factors. The bank\u2019s second-quarter estimates are above consensus.\n\nMore broadly, Citi held a mixed outlook on semiconductor stocks heading into Q2 results, suggesting a differentiated earnings season across the group.",

        "title": "ReelTime's RLTR Soars 54% in One Week, Outperforming Every Major AI Stock as Investors Embrace \"Reel Intelligence\"",
        "content": "RLTR becomes top-performing AI stock of the week, surpassing tech heavyweights Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), AMD, and Palantir (PLTR),\n\nBOTHELL, WA / ACCESS Newswire / July 18, 2025 / ReelTime Media (OTCID:RLTR) announced that it closed today at $0.0145, marking a 54% surge from its opening price of $0.0094 on Monday, July 14, 2025. This remarkable performance makes RLTR the top-performing AI stock of the week, surpassing tech heavyweights Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), AMD, and Palantir (PLTR), all of which posted modest gains or slight declines during the same period.\n\nThis comes just one day after ReelTime announced that it is launching a powerful media campaign beginning next week to introduce the public to Reel Intelligence (RI), its groundbreaking intelligence platform that experts have hailed as smarter, more capable, higher quality, more efficient, and significantly more environmentally friendly than any AI on the market today.\n\nWhile most AI sector giants experienced a quiet week, RLTR captured Wall Street's attention thanks to growing excitement surrounding its flagship platform, Reel Intelligence (\"RI\"), a next-generation intelligence model that many analysts believe represents the most significant technological breakthrough since the dawn of machine learning.\n\nThe Numbers Tell the Story\r\nFrom July 14 to July 18, 2025 , AI stock performance looked like this:\n\nCompany  Ticker  07/14 Close  07/18 Close  % Change ReelTime Media  RLTR  $0.0094  $0.0145  +54.3% Microsoft  MSFT  $508.00  $509.97  +0.39% NVIDIA  NVDA  $171.50  $172.39  +0.52% Alphabet  GOOGL  $183.60  $185.06  +0.79% Amazon  AMZN  $223.90  $226.12  +0.99% Meta Platforms  META  $701.10  $704.21  +0.44% AMD  AMD  $158.80  $156.99  -1.14% Palantir  PLTR  $154.10  $153.53  -0.37%\n\nThe comparison is clear: RLTR's growth outpaced every major AI and tech stock by more than 50-fold.\n\nAt the center of RLTR's meteoric rise is Reel Intelligence (\"RI\"), a revolutionary intelligence platform redefining what artificial intelligence can achieve. Unlike traditional AI systems that are siloed, hardware-bound, and energy-hungry, RI was engineered to break free from the limitations of today's models.\n\nRI is:\n\nSmarter - A self-learning architecture that evolves continuously without the need for costly retraining cycles. More Capable - RI seamlessly integrates features that traditionally require multiple platforms:\n\nNative 4K video generation (up to 30 seconds, cinematic quality). Grammy-eligible music composition with real vocals and emotional depth. Photorealistic image generation setting new industry benchmarks. Advanced coding capabilities , from development to debugging. More Efficient - Built on a distributed, chip-agnostic architecture that requires no massive data centers, drastically cutting energy use and costs. Environmentally Friendly - With its low-power distributed model, RI is the greenest AI solutions available, slashing the carbon footprint associated with traditional AI giants.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPerhaps most compelling, RI doesn't live in a confined server farm, it \" lives\" in the connected universe, tapping into a global knowledge network and synthesizing intelligence in real time. This unprecedented design allows RI to draw from the collective strength of top AIs while continuously integrating new data from across the digital ecosystem.\n\n\"The market's response is humbling and speaks volumes,\" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. \"RI is not just an improvement; it's a redefinition of artificial intelligence. Smarter, more capable, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable, RI represents the future of what AI should be.\"\n\nUntil now, RI has been a closely guarded secret, utilized primarily by elite industry insiders, AI experts, and power users who have marveled at its unmatched versatility and intelligence. RI is not just another AI, it's the evolution of intelligence, designed from the ground up to outperform traditional AI models at every level.\n\nUnlike conventional AI platforms that rely on massive energy-draining data centers, costly maintenance, and rigid chipsets, RI operates on a distributed computing model. It exists fluidly throughout the connected digital universe, self-learning in real time and continually improving without the constraints of physical infrastructure. This architecture makes RI not only vastly more efficient but also dramatically more environmentally sustainable than traditional AI systems.\n\nFrom lightning-fast research and pro-level image and video generation to Grammy-worthy music production, RI is the only all-in-one AI platform capable of seamlessly creating everything, from cinematic 4K video to chart-ready songs,under one roof. It is making many of those capabilities available to the public for free beginning Monday.\n\nRI's edge comes from its distributed processing model, which allows it to divide workloads intelligently across multiple specialized nodes throughout the connected universe. This makes RI faster, more scalable, and dramatically more energy-efficient than legacy centralized AI systems used by OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic.\n\nMore importantly, RI is self-learning. Rather than waiting for manual retraining, it continuously improves its output through proprietary, real-time feedback loops, enabling it to evolve faster than any competing model.\n\nAbout ReelTime Media (OTCID:RLTR)\r\nReelTime Media is a leader in digital media, AI innovation, and content creation technologies. Its flagship AI platform, Reel Intelligence (RI), is redefining what's possible in artificial intelligence by delivering an unparalleled combination of speed, capability, and sustainability.\n\nAbout ReelTime Rentals, Inc.\r\nReelTime Rentals, Inc.

        "title": "Cursor snaps up enterprise startup Koala in challenge to GitHub Copilot",
        "content": "Cursor logo | Image Credits:Cursor\n\nThe startup behind the viral AI coding app Cursor is snapping up top talent from AI enterprise startups in a bid to bolster its competition with Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot and win over businesses looking to supercharge their employees with AI coding tools.\n\nIn one recent case, Cursor maker Anysphere struck a deal to acquire the AI-powered customer relationship management (CRM) startup Koala, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nAs part of the deal, Cursor will bring on several of Koala\u2019s top engineers to build out a dedicated enterprise-readiness team. However, the entire Koala team will not be joining Anysphere, and Cursor does not plan to integrate the startup\u2019s core CRM product, a source told TechCrunch.\n\nKoala plans to shut down in September, the company said in a blog post published on Friday. The announcement comes just five months after Koala raised a $15 million Series A led by CRV, with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Recall Capital and Afore. Koala was nearly four years old, had roughly 30 employees according to LinkedIn, and had worked with clients such as Vercel, Statsig, and Retool.\n\nSources in this story requested anonymity to speak with TechCrunch about private matters. Koala and its founders did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. Cursor declined to comment.\n\nThe Koala deal paints a picture of the two types of AI startups we\u2019re seeing in 2025. There\u2019s Cursor, a juggernaut of an AI tool that is growing so fast it\u2019s starting to encroach on the AI space\u2019s largest players, including Microsoft and Anthropic. At the same time, there\u2019s a growing number of startups like Koala: B2B AI startups that seemed promising \u2014 with a co-founder from Meta and advisors like Jack Altman \u2014 but have quickly run out of steam.\n\nCursor is capitalizing on this disparity, leveraging middling AI startups as a means to build out its own enterprise offerings. Anysphere also recently hired the CEO of cybersecurity startup Resourcely, Travis McPeak, to lead the company\u2019s security teams, according to The Information.\n\nThese deals look a lot like Big Tech\u2019s reverse-acquihires, such as Meta\u2019s recent deal to hire Scale AI\u2019s leaders. Much like in Meta and Scale\u2019s deal, Cursor can now move quickly to build out new business segments while leaving questionable businesses behind.\n\nCursor hopes that Koala and Resourcely\u2019s talent will help it evolve from a personal developer tool that engineers quietly use at work and become an enterprise\u2011wide platform that companies pay large contracts to access. Most enterprises today that offer employees an AI tool choose Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, which works as an AI-powered extension to existing integrated development environments (IDEs) such as VS Code or JetBrains.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCursor, which is a standalone AI-powered IDE, needs to beat out GitHub Copilot to strike deals in many cases, and it often does in head-to-head tests. Still, Microsoft has the upper hand in the enterprise thanks to its long-standing relationships with legacy companies, as well as its large sales, security, and support teams.\n\nIn the last year, Cursor has decisively built out its go-to-market and sales team \u2014 which now contains dozens of employees. Several Cursor employees now spend their days visiting the offices of Fortune 500 companies and showing them how they can integrate Cursor\u2019s AI tools into their business, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nCursor\u2019s enterprise push seems to be gaining traction. Anysphere said it reached $500 million in ARR in June, and now works with more than half of the Fortune 500, including NVIDIA, Uber, and Adobe. A source familiar with the matter says that revenue has since grown, and an increasingly large share of that growth comes from enterprise deals.\n\nBut as Cursor competes with Microsoft, it also needs to fend off a growing field of threats.\n\nThe most pressing one is Anthropic, a crucial partner to Anysphere whose Claude Code product has grown rapidly in recent months. Cursor relies heavily on Anthropic\u2019s AI models to power its own coding products. (As one of its biggest customers, Cursor is also vital to Anthropic.)\n\nAt the same time, Google just scooped up the leadership team of Windsurf, a major competitor to Cursor in the AI-powered IDE space. Cognition, the maker of the AI coding agent Devin, acquired the rest of Windsurf\u2019s team, potentially offering a significant lift to both businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all of these are different types of AI tools, but employers tend to view the products similarly: as AI tools that can improve the productivity of software engineers. These employers might have the right idea. After all, Anthropic, Microsoft, Cursor, and Cognition are all developing AI coding agents which aim to automate workflows completely, which may be where the AI coding space converges.\n\nYou might ask, why is everyone competing with everyone else to build AI coding products? Coding tools have become one of the first AI products to find \u201cproduct market fit\u201d \u2014 the elusive goal that makes the ears of venture capitalists perk up. AI coding products are being used daily by millions of software engineers, and they have started to generate real revenue.\n\nPut another way, the race isn\u2019t just about building the best AI coding tool anymore. It\u2019s about who can scale their enterprise operations the fastest while the market is still up for grabs. With the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic all moving fast, Cursor\u2019s acquisition strategy may determine whether it joins their ranks or becomes another startup that couldn\u2019t scale fast enough.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft will likely sign the European Union\u2019s code of practice to help companies comply with the bloc\u2019s landmark artificial intelligence rules, its president told Reuters on Friday, while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) rebuffed the guidelines.\n\nDrawn up by 13 independent experts, the voluntary code of practice aims to provide legal certainty to signatories. They will have to publish summaries of the content used to train their general-purpose AI models and put in place a policy to comply with EU copyright law.\n\nThe code is part of the AI Act which came into force in June 2024 and will apply to Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook owner Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral and thousands of companies.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s likely we will sign. We need to read the documents,\" Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith told Reuters.\n\n\"Our goal is to find a way to be supportive and at the same time one of the things we really welcome is the direct engagement by the AI Office with industry,\" he said, referring to the EU\u2019s regulatory body for AI.\n\nMeta reiterated its criticism of the code.\n\n\"Meta won\u2019t be signing it. This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,\" Meta\u2019s chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan said in a blog post on LinkedIn on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. social media giant has the same concerns as a group of 45 European companies, he said.\n\n\"We share concerns raised by these businesses that this over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them,\" Kaplan said.\n\nOpenAI and Mistral have signed the code. </p>",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The 2019 suicide of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a New York jail cell\u00a0 generated conspiracy theories, fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s conservative MAGA movement, that he was killed by one of his famous connections.\n\nHere are some facts about Epstein and the current controversy:\n\nWHO IS JEFFREY EPSTEIN?\n\nThe Brooklyn-born Epstein, a former high school math teacher who later founded consulting and financial management firms, cultivated the rich and famous.\n\nHe was known for socializing with politicians and royalty, including Trump, Democratic President Bill Clinton, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew. Some friends and clients flew on his private plane and visited his Caribbean islands.\n\nTrump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During the 2021 trial of\u00a0Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier\u2019s longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, testified that Trump flew on Epstein\u2019s private plane multiple times. Trump has denied being on the plane.\n\nWHAT WAS EPSTEIN CHARGED WITH?\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state felony prostitution charge, after federal prosecutors agreed not to charge him with sex trafficking of minors. He served 13 months in jail and was required to register as a sex offender. That punishment is now widely regarded as too lenient.\n\nIn July 2019, the Justice Department charged Epstein with sex trafficking minors, including sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of girls, in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nEpstein died\u00a0on August 10, 2019, at age 66 by hanging himself in a Manhattan jail cell, an autopsy concluded. He was never tried on the 2019 charges.\n\nWHAT IS THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY OVER EPSTEIN?\n\nThough the New York City chief medical examiner determined that Epstein\u2019s death was a suicide by hanging, Epstein\u2019s ties to wealthy and powerful people prompted speculation that one or more of them wanted him silenced.\n\nIn several interviews, Trump left open the possibility that Epstein may not have died by suicide. During the 2024 presidential campaign, when asked on Fox News if he would declassify the Epstein files, Trump said, \"Yeah, yeah I would.\"\n\nIn February, Fox News asked Attorney General Pam Bondi whether the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein\u2019s client list, and she said, \"It\u2019s sitting on my desk right now to review.\"\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise. A Justice Department memo released on July 7 concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.\n\nThe demands by Trump supporters for more Epstein-related documents have caused a rare fracture within the president\u2019s base. Supporters, inspired by conservative talk show hosts and podcasters, have said the federal government is concealing records to protect wealthy and influential people with ties to Epstein.\n\nTrying to contain the fallout, Trump defended Bondi and accused his supporters in a Truth Social post of falling for a hoax, calling them \"weaklings\" who were helping Democrats.\n\nWith backlash from his base not abating, Trump on July 17 requested that Bondi ask a federal judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein\u2019s 2019 indictment.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nEven if Bondi asks the judge to release the grand jury transcripts, the ultimate decision is up to a judge.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings are generally kept secret under federal criminal procedure rules, with limited exceptions.\n\nIf a judge agrees to release the transcripts, it is likely that some material would be redacted, or blacked out because of privacy or security concerns.",

        "content": "Analysts revamp Alphabet stock price target before key earnings originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nGoogle is scaling up its AI infrastructure with a $25 billion investment in electricity, a move that\u2019s drawing interest from investors ahead of earnings.\n\nThe tech giant plans to build out data centers and AI infrastructure across the PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid in the United States.\n\nGoogle also signed a deal with Brookfield Asset Management  (BAM)  to purchase 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power across the U.S., according to an announcement on July 15.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb0Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5\n\nAs AI systems grow more powerful, demand for energy and computing power soars. Hyperscalers like Google need steady, low-carbon power, and they are planning to build the infrastructure to meet that demand.\n\nMicrosoft made a similar move in September 2024, signing a 20-year power agreement with Constellation Energy  (CEG)  to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 plant. That agreement will add 835 megawatts of carbon-free power to the PJM grid and help supply Microsoft\u2019s data centers.\n\nGoogle\u2019s push into hydroelectric power follows the same logic, ensuring enough energy to meet AI\u2019s rising demands to stay competitive in the cloud race.Alphabet stock is down 3% year-to-date.Image source: Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nGoogle ramps up AI investment\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet  (GOOGL)  reported capital expenditure of $17.2 billion, with most of it going into technical infrastructures, Alphabet's CFO Anat Ashkenazi said during the April earnings call.\n\nAshkenazi said the largest component was investment in servers, followed by data centers, to support the growth of business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind.\n\nRelated: Google gets unexpected boost from ChatGPT\n\nShe also confirmed that Alphabet is still committed to investing $75 billion this year in AI, regardless of any \"macroeconomic changes\" like tariffs.\n\n\"We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization,\" she said.\n\nOn April 24, Alphabet posted stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter, easing concerns about slowing growth in the face of rising AI competition.\n\nThe company reported earnings of $2.81 per share, well above the $2.01 that analysts had expected. Revenue was $90.23 billion, an increase of 12% from a year earlier. This beat Wall Street's forecast of $89.12 billion and a 10% growth rate.\n\nSearch and advertising, Alphabet\u2019s core businesses, continued to perform well even as competition in AI ramped up. The company is set to report its second-quarter results on July 23.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnalysts raise Alphabet stock price targets on AI and ad revenue optimism\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts raised their price targets for Alphabet before its earnings release next week.\n\nKeyBanc raised its price target on Alphabet to $215 from $195 and reiterated an overweight rating, thefly.com reported on July 17.\n\nRelated: Jim Cramer drops blunt 6-word message on Nvidia stock\n\nThe firm expects a solid Q2 with revenue of $94.6 billion driven by Search, YouTube, and Cloud. It also anticipates positive commentary on AI Mode, Waymo, and expense efficiencies.\n\nBMO Capital boosted its target to $208 from $200, citing growing confidence in Google\u2019s ability to drive ad revenue through AI.\n\nThe firm sees more spending from both existing advertisers and new small to mid-size businesses, and has lifted its forecast for Search growth to 10% for Q2.\n\nBMO also reintroduced Alphabet as a Top Pick, noting its shares still trade below the five-year average earnings multiple, which means the stock is a good value because it's trading at a lower price.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald also raised its price target to $196 from $171 while keeping a neutral rating.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nAmazon tries to make AI great again (or maybe for the first time) Veteran portfolio manager raises eyebrows with latest Meta Platforms move Google plans major AI shift after Meta\u2019s surprising $14 billion move\n\nThe firm expects Alphabet\u2019s second-quarter results to beat expectations, driven by strong performance in core Search and YouTube. However, Cantor Fitzgerald is waiting for more clarity on regulatory challenges before upgrading the stock.\n\nAlphabet stock closed at $183.58 on July 17.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT continues to dominate the desktop operating system market through Windows. The ongoing transition to Windows 11 from Windows 10 has been a major driver, boosting enterprise adoption. This, along with pent-up demand from an aging installed base, helped drive up global PC shipments in the second quarter of 2025. which rose 6.5% year over year to 68.4 million shipments, per IDC\u2019s latest data. \r\n\r\nPC vendors rushed to push high shipment volumes into the United States ahead of potentially higher tariffs. Lenovo led the PC shipment market with 24.8% share, followed by HP and Dell Technologies with 20.7% and 14.3% share, respectively. All three companies offer devices powered by Windows. As enterprises prepare for the end-of-support for Windows 10 in 2025, Windows 11 commercial deployments have witnessed a 75% year-over-year surge in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, showing strong enterprise-led PC upgrades.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has rolled out Copilot+ PCs, its latest AI-optimized Windows devices, which come bundled with exclusive features like Recall, Click to Do and a revamped Windows search, providing a more sophisticated device experience. The company has collaborated with Adobe, Canva and Zoom to integrate AI applications that improve user engagement.

        "title": "The $50 Billion Gap: How Bitcoin Went From Pizza Money To Nearly Flipping Amazon",
        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe crypto world is holding its breath as Bitcoin edges closer to a historic milestone. With a market cap of $2.338 trillion, Bitcoin now sits just $50 billion behind Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) $2.388 trillion valuation. That gap represents less than 2.1% of Amazon\u2019s total market cap\u2014a razor-thin margin that could disappear with a single strong trading day.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another crypto headline to scroll past. When the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency comes within striking distance of overtaking one of America\u2019s most successful corporations, it signals a fundamental shift in how investors value digital assets versus traditional business models.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nTrade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses \u2014 no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies. Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto \u2013 unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account.\n\nThe Numbers Tell a Compelling Story\n\nBased on current market data, Bitcoin sits at rank 6 globally by market cap, while Amazon holds the 5 position. The proximity is staggering\u2014Bitcoin would need just a 2.1% rally to surpass Amazon\u2019s valuation. Given Bitcoin\u2019s notorious volatility, where 5%-10% daily swings are commonplace, this gap could close faster than most investors realize.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price of $117,573 represents a 1.46% gain today alone, while Amazon\u2019s stock performance has been more subdued. The momentum appears to favor the digital asset, with Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day chart showing consistent upward trajectory compared to Amazon\u2019s more volatile pattern.\n\nWhy This Almost-Milestone Matters\n\nThe psychological impact of Bitcoin approaching Amazon\u2019s market cap cannot be overstated. Amazon revolutionized retail, built a cloud computing empire, and created one of the world\u2019s most efficient logistics networks. The company generates over $500 billion in annual revenue and employs more than 1.5 million people globally.\n\nTrending: New to crypto? Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying tradeon Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, exists purely as code\u2014a decentralized digital currency backed by mathematics and collective belief in its value proposition. The fact that it commands 98% of Amazon\u2019s market value forces a fundamental question: Are we witnessing the birth of a new asset class that rivals traditional corporate America?\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Leverage Factor\n\nHowever, this proximity comes with significant risks that investors must understand. Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge has been accompanied by massive increases in futures trading and derivative activity. When assets approach key psychological levels like flipping major corporations, leverage often amplifies both gains and potential losses.\n\nSmart money recognizes that Bitcoin\u2019s current position near Amazon creates a precarious situation. A sudden market correction could widen the gap quickly, while a sustained rally could propel Bitcoin not just past Amazon, but potentially toward the next targets: Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nSee Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase.\n\nBeyond the Headlines\n\nFor retail investors, Bitcoin\u2019s near-parity with Amazon validates crypto\u2019s evolution from speculative curiosity to mainstream asset class. Traditional portfolio theory suggested keeping crypto exposure to 1%-5% of total holdings. When Bitcoin commands a market cap approaching top S&P 500 companies, those allocation discussions become more complex.\n\nThe comparison also highlights fundamental differences in value creation. Amazon\u2019s market cap reflects discounted future cash flows from real business operations. Bitcoin\u2019s valuation depends entirely on its role as a store of value, inflation hedge, and medium of exchange in an increasingly digital economy.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWith Bitcoin trading at $117,573 and needing roughly a $50 billion market cap increase to flip Amazon, the question isn\u2019t whether this milestone will happen\u2014it\u2019s when. Historical precedent suggests that when Bitcoin approaches major psychological levels, it tends to break through with momentum.\n\nThe real significance lies in what comes next. If Bitcoin can sustainably trade above Amazon\u2019s market cap, it legitimizes crypto as a permanent fixture in institutional portfolios. This shift could trigger additional corporate adoption, further narrowing the gap between digital assets and traditional equities.\n\nFor now, investors should watch this space closely. The next few trading sessions could determine whether Bitcoin makes history or retreats to consolidate before its next assault on traditional finance.\n\nRead Next: Accredited investors can claim pre-IPO shares of Mode Mobile for just $0.30\u2014with up to 120% bonus shares\u2014before this Uber-style disruption hits the public markets\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nThis article The $50 Billion Gap: How Bitcoin Went From Pizza Money To Nearly Flipping Amazon originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A U.S. senator is asking the Pentagon for more information on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s reported use of Chinese engineers in maintaining military cloud computing systems, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the chamber\u2019s intelligence committee and also serves on its armed services committee, sent the letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after a report\u00a0this week in investigative journalism publication ProPublica.\n\nThe report detailed Microsoft\u2019s use of Chinese engineers to work on U.S. military computing systems under the supervision of U.S. \"digital escorts\" hired through subcontractors who have security clearances but often lacked the technical skills to assess whether the work of the Chinese engineers posed a cybersecurity threat.\n\nContacted by Reuters about the ProPublica report and Cotton\u2019s letter, Microsoft declined to comment. The company, a major contractor to the U.S. government, has had its systems breached by Chinese and Russian hackers. It told ProPublica that it disclosed its practices to the U.S. government during an authorization process.\n\nCotton asked the U.S. military for a list of contractors that use Chinese personnel and more information on how U.S. \"digital escorts\" are trained to detect suspicious activity.\n\n\"The U.S. government recognizes that China\u2019s cyber capabilities pose one of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by infiltration of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks, and supply chains,\" Cotton wrote in the letter. The U.S. military \"must guard against all potential threats within its supply chain, including those from subcontractors.\"\n\nIn a post on social media site X on Friday, Hegseth said Cotton\u2019s concerns were \"spot on\" and the Defense Department was already examining the matter.\n\n\"Foreign engineers \u2014 from any country, including of course China \u2014 should NEVER be allowed to maintain or access (Defense Department) systems,\" Hegseth said in the post.",

Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement:\n\nGrowing AI Usage in Search to Aid GOOGL\u2019s Q2 Results\n\nAlphabet\u2019s to-be-reported quarterly results are expected to benefit from solid momentum in Search and Cloud businesses. \r\n\r\nThe integration of Generative AI (Gen AI) technology into the search engine has been benefiting Google Search. AI-powered Circle to Search is now available on more than 300 million Android devices, with people using it to shop, translate text, and learn more about the world around them. Circle to Search is driving additional Search and is gaining popularity among younger users. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview\u2019s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 Search and other revenues is pegged at $52.36 billion, indicating 8% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGOOGL Cloud Gaining Market Share\n\nAlphabet has been rapidly growing in the booming cloud computing market. Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Azure. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is expected to have driven growth in the Google Cloud segment. \r\n\r\nAccording to Synergy Research Group data, Google Cloud, along with Microsoft, is gaining market share, while AWS continues to lead with a 29% market share in the first quarter of 2025. Alphabet and Microsoft had 22% and 12% market share, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $13.04 billion, indicating 26% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online in 2025, cloud revenues are expected to see increased variability. This is expected to have hurt Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGOOGL Shares Lag Sector, IndustryZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have declined 3.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Over the same timeframe, the sector has returned 9.5% while the industry has dropped 0.9%.\n\nGOOGL Stock\u2019s Performance\n\nGOOGL shares are overvalued, as suggested by Value Score C. \r\n\r\nCurrently, GOOGL is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.43X compared with the industry\u2019s 5.49X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnically, GOOGL shares are displaying a bullish trend as they trade above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.\n\nGOOGL Trades Above 50-day & 200-day SMAsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud Growth to Drive GOOGL Prospects\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from an expanding clientele and rich partner base. Google Cloud is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA\u2019s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer. The addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing space. \r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s expanding clientele is expected to boost Alphabet\u2019s top line. Google Cloud is now expanding its footprint based on the latest deals with Ecobank in Africa and BBVA. BBVA\u2019s deal with Google Cloud will enable Alphabet to deploy Google Workspace with Gemini across the global operations of the bank. Meanwhile, the Ecobank collaboration aims at transforming financial services with advanced analytics and AI and driving digital empowerment across Africa. This offers a significant growth opportunity for Google Cloud in one of the most underpenetrated regions of the globe.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold Ahead of Q2?\n\nAlphabet\u2019s growing Gen AI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Its dominant position in the Search market is a strong growth driver. However, a stretched valuation, stiff competition in the cloud space and growing regulatory headwinds make GOOGL shares risky for investors ahead of second-quarter 2025 results.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "title": "Jefferies raises Builders FirstSource stock price target to $148 on resilient margins",
        "content": "Investing.com - Jefferies raised its price target on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR), a prominent player in the Building Products industry with a market capitalization of $13.7 billion, to $148.00 from $137.00 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. According to InvestingPro data, the company maintains a healthy financial position with a \"GOOD\" overall health score.\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis indicates that while demand remains soft for the building materials supplier, it has not deteriorated further, with pricing and margins holding steady despite market challenges. The company\u2019s strong financial position is evidenced by its comfortable liquidity ratio of 1.82, with liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations.\n\nJefferies noted there could be some risk to consensus estimates in the second half of the year due to weaker new residential construction, but believes the lower end of Builders FirstSource\u2019s own guidance remains achievable.\n\nThe research firm pointed to several potential tailwinds for the industry, including recent declines in U.S. and European natural gas prices, a weaker dollar, and higher pricing in North America.\n\nIn the same research note, Jefferies commented on  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK), expecting it to deliver in-line second-quarter results with third-quarter consensus estimates appearing \"well calibrated.\"\n\nIn other recent news, Builders FirstSource has announced its offering of $750 million in senior unsecured notes at a 6.750% interest rate, set to mature in 2035. The company intends to use the proceeds to repay existing debt under its senior secured ABL facility. This move aligns with Builders FirstSource\u2019s strategy to effectively manage its debt portfolio and maintain a strong balance sheet. Additionally, Oppenheimer has lowered its price target for Builders FirstSource from $165 to $155, citing a weaker outlook for single-family housing starts and a challenging competitive environment. Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, highlighting the company\u2019s long-term potential in an underbuilt housing market.\n\nIn a leadership update, Builders FirstSource has appointed Gayatri Narayan as President of Technology and Digital Solutions, bringing over two decades of experience from companies like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, the company has declassified its Board of Directors and amended its corporate governance structure to limit officer liability, a move aimed at enhancing accountability and attracting top executive talent. Finally, Builders FirstSource\u2019s former CEO, David Rush, has joined the Board of Directors at Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP), bringing extensive industry experience to the role.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "content": "July 18 - CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) shares slid about 7% on Thursday after HSBC initiated coverage with a Reduce rating and a $32 price target, according to a recent note.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CRWV.\n\nThe $32 target implies a roughly 77% drop from Wednesday's close, as analyst Abhishek Shukla flagged the cloud vendor's soaring costs and limited diversification options. CoreWeave's infrastructure is built around GPUs, or graphics processing units, specialized processors designed for AI workloads.\n\nSince going public in March, CoreWeave's stock has more than tripled, but the company's heavy cash burn and high debt have unsettled investors. Shukla noted that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounted for about 72% of first?quarter revenue and cautioned that hyperscalers may bypass CoreWeave and source GPUs directly from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHSBC also warned that rising data?center rent, already at 16% of Q1 revenue, and steep financing costs, with implied interest rates near 12.4%, could further pressure margins. As CoreWeave seeks to broaden its customer base, marketing and R&D expenses may climb, potentially squeezing profitability from both ends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

CoreWeave, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the worst-performing companies on Thursday.\n\nCoreWeave dropped by 7.57 percent on Thursday to close at $132.21 apiece as investors disposed of shares following an investment firm\u2019s pessimistic outlook for the company.\n\nIn a market note, CoreWeave, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWV) earned a \u201creduce\u201d rating and a meager $32 price target from HSBC Global Research, marking a 76-percent downside from its latest closing price.\n\nAccording to HSBC, the rating revision was based on CoreWeave, Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWV) overreliance on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHowever, it noted that such clients have not adopted CoreWeave, Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWV) software services, weakening the company\u2019s competitiveness and customer stickiness.\n\n\u201cSelling more value-added services driven by the software stack, as is done by general-purpose clouds, may be key to achieving stronger returns,\u201d the market note said.CoreWeave (CRWV) Drops as HSBC Turns Bearish\n\nA close-up of a businesswoman using a laptop, being illuminated by the AI-enabled cloud interface sponsored by the company.\n\n\u201dBut CoreWeave would first need to successfully shift to a general-purpose cloud offering and diversify away from Microsoft and Open AI (which together accounted for more than 72% of its revenue and most of its backlog in 1Q25) towards customers that require CoreWeave\u2019s full software stack.\u201d\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "title": "Oracle's AI-driven surge: Can its stock rally last?",
        "content": "Oracle (ORCL), a legacy tech player once lagging behind in the AI arms race, is now sprinting out front.\n\nThe stock is up more than 45% this year \u2014 handily outperforming AI darlings Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) \u2014 thanks to massive cloud deals and surging AI demand. With Wall Street watching closely, the question now is whether Oracle can turn its growth story into lasting earnings power.\n\n\"Oracle has been growing [revenue] by mid-single digits, and now it could be growing 15% to 20% [annually] for the next few years,\" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. \"That's why the stock has done so well.\"\n\nThe company recently inked a wave of cloud infrastructure deals, including one contract involving the rental of high-powered graphics chips (GPUs), which are essential for training and running AI models. One such agreement could add as much as $30 billion to Oracle's revenue by 2028.\n\nIts Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) division has positioned itself as a lower-cost, high-performance alternative to Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud.\n\nThe hyperscaler is also part of the Stargate project, a $500 billion initiative launched earlier this year alongside SoftBank Group (SFTBY), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and Metagenomi (MGX) to advance US AI development. Elsewhere, Oracle has committed $3 billion to expand AI infrastructure in Europe.\n\nOracle has garnered analyst upgrades, including from Scotiabank (BNS), which recently initiated coverage with a $300 price target, citing its strong position in AI infrastructure. Its analysts described the 48-year-old company as \"transitioning into a new paradigm.\"\n\nBut not all firms see Oracle spreading its wings \u2014 D.A. Davidson maintains a Neutral rating and a $220 target, and Mizuho forecast a pullback to around $180.\n\n\"The current price already reflects the upside, unless a significant acceleration in earnings growth can be achieved,\" Luria said. \"The stock is starting to look pretty expensive.\"\n\nNYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price\u2022USD\n\n(ORCL)\n\nFollow View Quote Details\n\n248.63\n\n-\n\n(-0.14%)\n\nAs of 9:51:25 AM EDT. Market Open.  Advanced Chart\n\nThe fast-growing cloud business is capital-intensive and operates on thinner margins. On the other hand, Oracle's traditional software, hardware, and maintenance contracts business is in decline. But the segment makes up 60% of the company's business and has around a 50% margin, per Luria.\n\n\"The key is not just revenue growth, it's whether Oracle can convert that into profitable earnings,\" Luria said. \"That's what will determine if the stock can keep climbing.\"\n\nIn its latest quarter, Oracle reported $15.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year, and earnings per share of $1.70, up from $1.67 a year earlier. Cloud infrastructure sales jumped 52% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnalysts have raised their earnings estimates for Oracle, reflecting optimism about its AI and cloud growth. The consensus EPS forecast for fiscal 2025 is $6.72, an 11% increase year over year, and $7.66 for fiscal 2026.\n\nWhile some on Wall Street worry that Oracle's AI push may not translate to meaningful earnings, others say its cloud infrastructure platform is the future.\n\n\"Oracle's AI story isn't just about software or language models, it's about OCI, their cloud infrastructure platform that competes directly with Microsoft Azure and Amazon's Web Services,\" Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at Water Tower Research, said on Yahoo Finance's Market Catalysts.\n\nSeparately, Oracle co-founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison is now the world's second-richest person, surpassing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. His net worth is $251 billion, up nearly $60 billion in 2025, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Shares have increased 828.84% to $511.7 since then.\n\nTwo analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 18, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft's MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL, Arm Holdings ARM and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.\n\n2025: Wall Street's Ascent Up the Wall of Worry\n\nNo two years on Wall Street are the same. However, 2025 is an extreme example of how one year can differ from the next. 2024 was marked by a dovish Federal Reserve board and a slow grind higher in the major market indices.\n\n2025 started with a returning administration in Washington DC (albeit four years later), the 'DeepSeek' scare, and the 'Liberation Day' fallout. First, a Chinese company released the 'DeepSeek\" chatbot, which had similar performance to OpenAI and Microsoft's wildly popular 'ChatGPT' large language model, and was allegedly 'trained' at a fraction of the cost, suggesting that the company had found the holy grail of AI.\n\nIn the following weeks, AI leaders such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Arm Holdings and Advanced Micro Devices would suffer swift losses as China threatened to take the lead in the high-stakes race for artificial intelligence supremacy. Then, on April 2nd, President Donald Trump announced a sweeping package of tariffs on hundreds of countries, accelerating the losses and sending stocks into bear market territory.\n\nOn April 9th, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on 'reciprocal tariffs and stocks soared. Since then, stocks reacted positively to a preliminary and unexpected trade deal between the US and its largest trading partner, China. Finally, despite rampant investor fears, stocks exhibited resilience and shook off a targeted US attack on Iranian nuclear plants.\n\n3 Trading Takeaways from 2025\n\nSavvy investors understand that there are always lessons to be learned. Three of my key takeaways include:\n\n1. Time Heals on Wall Street: Whether it was DeepSeek or the tariff fallout, the US market tends to shake off bad news as time passes.\n\n2. Headlines can be a Distraction: Nearly every economist on Wall Street predicted that the Trump tariff policy would cause rampant inflation. In reality, the inflation rate is hovering near its lowest level in multiple years.\n\n3. Price Action is Truth: The 21-day moving average is a fantastic intermediate-term guide for investors. In the first part of the year, it warned investors to stay out of the market. However, once the market regained the 21-day moving average, it never looked back.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt's been a turbulent year, but 2025 has once again proven Wall Street's ability to climb the proverbial \"wall of worry.\" From the initial DeepSeek shock and the tariff scares, the market has demonstrated remarkable resilience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren't winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "CoreWeave to Set up New Data Center: Overcapacity or Future-Proofing?",
        "content": "CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV is investing $6 billion to build a new state-of-the-art AI data center in Lancaster, PA. The data center, designed for advanced AI workloads, will have an initial capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) and a potential to scale up to 300MW. It is one of the first large-scale AI-focused data centers in the Mid-Atlantic region and aimed at bolstering U.S. competitiveness in AI.\n\nThis new facility adds to CoreWeave\u2019s growing network of data centers. It has a network of 33 purpose-built AI-data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420MW of active power. The Lancaster facility will be adding to the company\u2019s 1.6 gigawatt (GW) of contracted power, offering a multiyear runway in power capacity.\n\nThis infrastructure buildout is underpinned by surging demand for high-performance AI compute. For a hypergrowth company, data-center expansion to support accelerating demand amid intense competition is more of strategic future-proofing than anything else. Hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Corporation MSFT operate hundreds of facilities globally.\n\nOn the last earnings call, CRWV management highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. CRWV\u2019s strong backlog of $25.9 billion at the end of the last reported quarter underscores its growing market share. CRWV inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion, while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion (to be included in backlog from second quarter) expansion with a big AI enterprise.\n\nOf course, this aggressive expansion comes with risks. Higher capex, subsequent rising interest costs and macro uncertainty could test execution. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025. Nonetheless, CoreWeave\u2019s self-amortizing debt structure and strong revenue visibility offer meaningful downside protection.\n\nData Center Footprint for Competitors\n\nMicrosoft has a vast network of data centers for its Azure platform. It has more than 400 data centers across 70-plus Azure regions. Earlier in January 2025, MSFT announced a $80 billion investment toward the development of AI-enabled data centers globally for fiscal 2025, with more than half of the investment earmarked for the United States.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company spent $21.4 billion on capex and $16.7 billion on cash for PP&E. MSFT highlighted that nearly half of the cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and more. The remainder focused on servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to fulfill rising AI demand, including a $315 billion customer backlog. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, capex will grow at a slower rate than fiscal 2025, with a higher share of short-lived assets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNebius Group N.V. NBIS is focusing on building a global footprint, with capacity in the United States, Europe and the Middle East amid accelerating demand for its AI-infrastructure services. In the last reported quarter, Nebius added three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel. Infrastructure enhancement helps reduce latency, diversify risk and extend support for global customer requirements, which is crucial for enterprise AI workloads.\n\nIn June 2025, Nebius announced private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive-up revenue opportunities in 2026. It has an ambitious $2 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025. NBIS plans to build a data-center infrastructure pipeline that can offer scalability to more than 1GW of power. With this, NBIS expects significantly higher revenue potential beyond its current guidance.\n\nCRWV Price Performance and Estimates\n\nShares of CoreWeave have lost 21.9% over the past month against the Internet Software industry\u2019s growth of 1.8%. CoreWeave\u2019s share price took a hit after it announced the acquisition of Core Scientific on July 7. There is intense investor scrutiny regarding the deal. By taking ownership of Core Scientific's 1.3GW power infrastructure footprint, with an additional 1GW expansion potential, CoreWeave gains ample room to grow its AI infrastructure. With demand for AI compute soaring, this extra capacity provides a strong long-term advantage.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRWV\u2019s earnings for 2025 has been unchanged over the past 30 days.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 for decades, and in the process has become one of the world's richest men. (Forbes puts his net worth at $37 billion.) Despite his fortune, Buffett is known for living a modest lifestyle, by billionaire standards. His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\n\nTop Technology Stocks\n\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\n\nHigh Momentum Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nExcess Returns Investing Podcast\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.
