        "content": "[The Wall Street Journal sign in its building]\nManakin\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against the _Wall Street Journal_ and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch, over the newspaper's report that he had contributed a racy letter to a birthday album for disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe move represents another escalation in an issue that has generated controversy for Trump over the last two weeks, ever since the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on July 7 they had found no evidence to support long-held conspiracy theories about Epstein's death and his clients. The financier died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019.\n\n\"We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS 'article' in the useless 'rag' that is, The Wall Street Journal,\" Trump said on his Truth Social service on Friday evening.\n\n\"This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,\" the President added.\n\nThe _Wall Street Journal_ is owned by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWS]), where Rupert Murdoch serves as chairman emeritus.\n\n\"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,\" a Dow Jones spokesperson told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement.\n\nThe WSJ's Friday report claimed that Trump contributed a racy letter to a leatherbound birthday album compiled by Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003. Just hours after its publication, Trump called [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468735-trump-threatens-to-sue-wsj-over-epstein-story-clears-doj-to-release-grand-jury-testimony] the report \"fake\" and threatened to sue the newspaper, parent News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWS]), and Murdoch.\n\nTrump also authorized the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to the Epstein case. A motion to unseal the grand jury transcripts was filed by U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Friday.\n\nWall Street, for the most part, has not given much attention to the Epstein issue, with market participants instead focusing on economic data, quarterly earnings, and trade developments.

        "title": "The Saturday Spread: Using Science to Pinpoint Empirically Enticing Trades in WMT, OKTA and RCAT",
        "content": "It\u2019s the one question that the financial publication industry consistently refuses to answer: how likely is it that the broadcasted thesis happened because of the signal or undervaluation and not just by random chance?\n\nPretty much all finpub articles offer an investment or trading idea; otherwise, what would be the point of reading the material? If there was no edge to be found, then you should simply put your money into the benchmark S&P 500 SPDR (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY]) and call it a day. But instead, the concept of reading financial analyses is to extract alpha \u2014 generating returns that exceed what you\u2019d expect from passive exposure to a broader index.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just extract alpha without understanding what you are benchmarking against. And that\u2019s the point of the null hypothesis. In the financial realm, the null hypothesis is the assumption that there is no mispricing. Put another way, whether you read the finpub article in question or not, your performance will not deviate statistically from what is expected.\n\nBy logical deduction, our job as analysts is to reject the null; specifically, that the alternative hypothesis that we present is not just a materialization of random noise but an empirically meaningful signal. To determine this meaningfulness, analysts should run a binomial test, which helps narrow down truly interesting ideas from typical price discovery chaos.\n\nHowever, looking at share prices or their derivatives for recurring patterns represents a gargantuan task. Instead, I prefer compressing (discretizing) price action into market breadth or sequences of accumulative and distributive sessions. By analyzing root demand, we can more easily pinpoint unusual quantitative signals \u2014 signals that can point to asymmetric opportunities.\n\nYes, the emphasis on scientific methodologies is a financial red pill. But if we\u2019re going to beat the market, we have to think differently. Below are three ideas to mull over this coming week.\n\nWALMART (WMT)\n\nLet me be blunt: big-box retailer Walmart (WMT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/wmt]) is a truly boring idea. But even industry juggernauts can occasionally broadcast signals that make them very intriguing. For WMT stock, this signal is what I would abbreviate as the 6-4-D sequence: six up weeks, four down weeks, negative trajectory across the 10-week period.\n\nSince January 2019, this sequence has materialized 17 times. It\u2019s an odd pattern given that the balance of accumulative sessions outweighs distributive, yet the overall trajectory is negative. Still, what\u2019s most intriguing is that in 76.47% of cases, the following week\u2019s price action results in upside, with a median return of 1%.\n\nOn Friday, WMT stock closed at $95.05, meaning that if the implications of the 6-4-D sequence pan out, it could hit $96 soon, perhaps in a week. Should the bulls maintain control of the market over the next three to four weeks, a push toward $96.55, perhaps even $97, may be on the cards based on past analogs.\n\nThe null hypothesis in this case is the baseline probability of WMT stock assuming no unusual mispricing, which is 57.02%. However, the much higher probability of the 6-4-D sequence \u2014 which has an empirically intriguing p-value of 0.0819 (implying 91.81% confidence that the signal isn\u2019t random) \u2014 incentivizes a debit-based options strategy.\n\nWith that in mind, aggressive speculators may consider the 95/97BULL CALL SPREAD [https://www.barchart.com/options/learning-center/bull-call] expiring Aug. 8. BARCHART PREMIER [https://www.barchart.com/get-barchart-premier?ref=optJosh] members can quickly pinpoint the most viable trades, thereby eliminating much of the guesswork involved in options trading.\n\nThe above transaction involves buying the $95 call and simultaneously selling the $97 call, for a net debit paid of $93. Should WMT stock rise through the short strike price at expiration, the maximum reward stands at $107, a payout of 115%.\n\nOKTA (OKTA)\n\nAnother intriguing idea that popped on the quantitative radar is Oka (OKTA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/OKTA]), an identity and access management company. While OKTA stock has been a strong performer, gaining over 21% on a year-to-date basis, it has also been a choppy name. For example, in the trailing month, the security is down 4%. Still, this may open up a trading opportunity.\n\nIn the past two months, OKTA stock has printed a 4-6-D sequence: four up weeks, six down weeks, negative trajectory. Since January 2019, this particular sequence has occurred 37 times. Ordinarily, it would be associated with pessimism given the greater balance of distributive sessions, along with the negative trajectory.\n\nHowever, in 64.86% of cases, the following week\u2019s price action results in upside, with a median return of 4.93%. Should the bulls maintain control for the next three weeks, investors may see an added performance boost of 2.06%. With OKTA closing at $95.43 on Friday, it could potentially be on pace to exceed $102 over the next few weeks.\n\nHere, the null hypothesis is a baseline probability of 52.63%. Further, the 4-6-D sequence runs a p-value of only 0.0917. All things considered, the framework incentivizes a debit-based strategy.\n\nWith that said, speculators may consider the 97.50/100 BULL CALL SPREAD expiring Aug. 15. This trade requires a net debit of $96, with a gargantuan payout of over 160%.\n\nRED CAT (RCAT)\n\nDefense contractor Red Cat (RCAT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RCAT]) \u2014 which specializes in advanced solutions such as reconnaissance drones \u2014 is fundamentally intriguing for obvious reasons if you\u2019ve been keeping pace with geopolitical news. However, it\u2019s also risky. RCAT stock is down more than 12% YTD and that\u2019s including the 30% lift in the trailing five sessions.\n\nIf choppiness isn\u2019t your thing, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. In the past two months, RCAT stock has printed a 6-4-U sequence: six up weeks, four down weeks, positive trajectory. Since January 2019, this sequence has materialized 44 times. With RCAT, the higher balance of accumulative sessions tends to attract more bullish behavior. Therefore, in 56.82% of cases, the following week\u2019s price action results in upside, with a median return of 9.31%.\n\nOn the surface, that might not seem like a significant edge. However, RCAT\u2019s null hypothesis is a baseline probability of 45.32%. Given that the security natively features a negative bias, it\u2019s enticing that the 6-4-U sequence tilts the odds firmly in the bulls\u2019 favor. This signal has a p-value of 0.1398, which is higher than the rest. However, given the open-system nature of the stock market, it\u2019s arguably empirically intriguing.\n\nThose who really want to swing for the fences may consider the 11/12 BULL CALL SPREAD expiring Aug. 15. This trade requires a net debit of $40, with a max payout of 150%.\n\n_ On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto [https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/125/josh-enomoto] did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) Friday closed down -0.01%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI)\u00a0(DIA) closed down -0.32%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -0.05%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.08%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.10%.\n\nStocks gave up an early advance on Friday and settled slightly lower on mixed earnings results and weakness in health insurance providers.\u00a0 Netflix fell by more than 5% and weighed on technology stocks after the company forecasted full-year operating margins below consensus.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nAlso, health insurance stocks retreated after Humana lost a lawsuit to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments and after Elevance Health was downgraded.\n\nStocks maintained slight losses Friday afternoon after the Financial Times reported that President Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any trade deal with the European Union (EU), as Mr. Trump has remained unmoved by the latest EU offer to reduce car tariffs.\u00a0 Also, the Financial Times said that EU trade commissioner Sefcovic gave a downbeat assessment of recent trade talks in Washington on Friday to EU ambassadors.\n\nStock indexes initially moved higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs.\u00a0 Bullish factors included the stronger-than-expected housing starts report and generally upbeat earnings reports.\u00a0 Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to a 5-month high.\n\nFalling bond yields are supportive of stocks following dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday evening, who stated that he supports a Fed interest rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0 Also, an easing of inflation expectations in Friday's University of Michigan's July inflation expectations report was bullish for T-notes and stocks.\u00a0The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.43%.\n\nUS June housing starts rose +4.6% m/m to 1.321 million, stronger than expectations of 1.300 million.\u00a0 Also, June building permits, a proxy for future construction, unexpectedly rose +0.2% m/m to 1.397 million versus expectations of a -0.5% m/m decline to 1.387 million.\n\nThe University of Michigan's July US consumer sentiment index rose +1.1 to a 5-month high of 61.8, stronger than expectations of 61.5.\n\nThe University of Michigan's US July 1-year inflation expectations indicator fell to a 5-month low of +4.4%, better than expectations of no change at +5.0%.\u00a0Also, the July 5-10 year inflation expectations indicator eased to a 5-month low of +3.6%, weaker than expectations of +3.9%.\n\nThursday evening, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said, \"With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\u00a0 I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC's policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.\"\n\nRecent trade news has put some downward pressure on stocks.\u00a0 President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, President Trump last weekend announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 5% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on September 16-17.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week as big bank earnings results came in stronger than expected. \u00a0Early results now show S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +3.2% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.33%. \u00a0China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.50%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 fell from a 2.5-week high and closed down -0.21%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Friday closed up +8.5 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield fell -2.3 bp to 4.428%.\u00a0 T-notes rose Friday on dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who said he backs a Fed rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0Also, falling inflation expectations in Friday's University of Michigan report were bullish for T-notes.\n\nOn the bearish side, Friday's US housing starts report was stronger than expected.\u00a0 Also, Friday's increase in the University of Michigan US July consumer sentiment to a 5-month high was negative for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.0 bp to 2.695%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1.5-month high of 4.684% and finished up +1.9 bp to 4.674%.\n\nEurozone May construction output fell -1.7% m/m, the biggest decline in nearly 2.5-years.\n\nThe German June PPI fell -1.3% y/y, right on expectations and the steepest pace of decline in 9 months.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nWeakness in managed health care stocks weighed on the broader market Friday.\u00a0 Molina Healthcare (MOH) closed down more than -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500, and Elevance Health (ELV) closed down more than -8% after Leerink Partners downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform.\u00a0 Also, Centene (CNC) closed down more than -3%, and CVS Health Corp (CVS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) closed down more than -2%.\u00a0 In addition, Humana (HUM) closed down more than -1% after it lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) closed down more than -5% after forecasting a full-year operating margin of 29.5%, below the consensus of 29.7%.\n\n3M Co (MMM) closed down more than -3% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials after cutting its full-year organic sales estimate to +2% from a previous forecast of +2% to +3%.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) closed down more than -36% after it said another patient died from acute liver failure after receiving one of its experimental gene therapies for a muscle disease.\n\nAutoliv (ALV) closed down more than -4% after reporting Q2 adjusted operating margin of 9.30%, below the consensus of 9.35%.\n\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR) closed down more than -3% after

billion.\n\nTalen Energy (TLN) closed up more than +24% after acquiring gas-fired power plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio for $3.5 billion.\n\nInvesco Ltd (IVZ) closed up more than +15% to lead gainers

closed up more than +7% after reporting Q2 total net interest income of $860 million, well above the consensus of $794.7 million.\n\nRegions Financial (RF) closed up more than +6% after reporting Q2

S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) fell -0.08%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) fell -0.10%.\n\nStocks gave up an early advance on Friday and settled slightly lower on mixed earnings results and weakness in health insurance providers.\u00a0 Netflix fell by more than 5% and weighed on technology stocks after the company forecasted full-year operating margins below consensus.\n\nAlso, health insurance stocks retreated after Humana lost a lawsuit to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments and after Elevance Health was downgraded.\u00a0\n\nStocks maintained slight losses Friday afternoon after the Financial Times reported that President Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any trade deal with the European Union (EU), as Mr. Trump has remained unmoved by the latest EU offer to reduce car tariffs.\u00a0 Also, the Financial Times said that EU trade commissioner Sefcovic gave a downbeat assessment of recent trade talks in Washington on Friday to EU ambassadors.\n\nStock indexes initially moved higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs.\u00a0 Bullish factors included the stronger-than-expected housing starts report and generally upbeat earnings reports.\u00a0 Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to a 5-month high.\n\nFalling bond yields are supportive of stocks following dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday evening, who stated that he supports a Fed interest rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0 Also, an easing of inflation expectations in Friday's University of Michigan's July inflation expectations report was bullish for

better than expectations of no change at +5.0%.\u00a0Also, the July 5-10 year inflation expectations indicator eased to a 5-month low of +3.6%, weaker than expectations of +3.9%.\n\nThursday evening, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said, \"With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\u00a0 I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC's policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.\"\n\nRecent trade news has put some downward pressure on stocks.\u00a0 President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, President Trump last weekend announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 5% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on September 16-17.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week as big bank earnings results came in stronger than expected. \u00a0Early results now show S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +3.2% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.33%. \u00a0China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.50%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 fell from a 2.5-week high and closed down -0.21%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) on Friday closed up +8.5 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield fell -2.3 bp to 4.428%.\u00a0 T-notes rose Friday on dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who said he backs a Fed rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0Also, falling inflation expectations in Friday's University of Michigan report were bullish for T-notes.\n\nOn the bearish side, Friday's US housing starts report was stronger than expected.\u00a0 Also, Friday's increase in the University of Michigan US July consumer sentiment to a 5-month high was negative for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.0 bp to 2.695%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1.5-month high of 4.684% and finished up +1.9 bp to 4.674%.\n\nEurozone May construction output fell -1.7% m/m, the biggest decline in nearly 2.5-years.\n\nThe German June PPI fell -1.3% y/y, right on expectations and the steepest pace of decline in 9 months.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nWeakness in managed health care stocks weighed on the broader market Friday.\u00a0 Molina Healthcare (MOH [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MOH/overview]) closed down more than -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500, and Elevance Health (ELV

        "content": "NEW YORK, United States, July 18th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nGSR, crypto's capital markets partner, today announced an investment and strategic partnership with MEI Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:MEIP) (\u201cMEI\u201d), in which it will serve as both strategic advisor and digital asset treasury manager. The $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) into MEI represents a significant step toward institutionalizing Litecoin as a treasury asset.\n\nGSR will work closely with Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee, who brings deep technical credibility and a long-term perspective on Litecoin\u2019s evolution, with support from the Litecoin Foundation. Lee and a GSR appointee will also join MEI\u2019s Board of Directors. This initiative follows MEI\u2019s previously announced review of strategic alternatives and reflects its new mission in alignment with both the Litecoin Foundation and GSR\u2019s digital asset management platform.\n\n\u201cLitecoin has consistently delivered a stable, low-cost, and accessible network for over a decade,\u201d said Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin. \u201cWith leading global transaction volume on platforms like BitPay, Litecoin is trusted by users and integrated across retail and payments. This partnership with GSR and MEI brings that utility and mission into an institutional setting for the first time.\u201d\n\nMEI\u2019s leadership is driving this strategic shift, viewing the partnership as a bridge between public markets and crypto-native innovation. With GSR serving as asset manager and execution partner, MEI will be well-positioned to manage LTC as a treasury asset.\n\n\u201cThis initiative represents the first time a public company is aligning its treasury strategy with Litecoin at an institutional level,\u201d said Joshua Riezman, US Chief Strategy Officer, GSR. \u201cIt reflects rising institutional confidence in LTC\u2019s credibility, resilience, and regulatory clarity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is already meaningful institutional interest in Litecoin, but few mechanisms exist to access it in a secure and structured way,\u201d said Quynh Ho, Head of Venture Investment, GSR. \u201cThis investment is designed to close that gap by enabling access to an asset with remarkable staying power.\u201d\n\nWith GSR as an investor, strategic advisor, and asset manager, the collaboration creates potential momentum for LTC\u2019s future growth in decentralized finance. GSR's broader involvement in the space, including the incubation of the Polygon-based protocol Katana, highlights its expertise in supporting emerging ecosystems.\n\nCharlie Lee and GSR acted as lead investors, alongside participation from the Litecoin Foundation and prominent crypto venture capital firms and infrastructure providers, including Mozayyx, Parafi, HiveMind, Primitive, RLH Capital, Delta Blockchain, and CoinFund, among other financial institutions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGSR continues to invest in the broader digital asset ecosystem, offering capital solutions, liquidity, and strategic advisory services to partners at all stages of growth.\n\nAbout GSR\n\nGSR is crypto\u2019s capital markets partner, delivering market-making, institutional-grade OTC trading, and strategic venture backing to founders and institutions. With more than a decade of experience, we provide strategic guidance, market intelligence, and access to a global network to help teams scale.\n\nUsers can follow GSR on X or visit www.gsr.io for more information.\n\nContact\n\nVP Public Relations\r\nHaley Malanga\r\nGSR\r\nhaley.malanga@gsr.io\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2025 etf.com.

Meanwhile, the Dow (DJI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI]) remains just shy of its own record, trailing by less than 2%.\n\nDespite the ongoing rally, an air of caution persists among investors. Concerns around tariffs, inflation, stretched valuations, interest rate policy, and geopolitical tensions continue to cast a shadow over the market\u2019s longer-term outlook. \n\nAs equities push higher, the central question becomes: Will the momentum continue, or is a pullback looming?

        "content": "[The News Corporation logo on their headquarters building in New York, NY, USA, August 18, 2022.]\nJHVEPhoto\n\n_Seeking Alpha's daily roundup of statements, announcements and remarks that could impact markets, sectors or individual stocks. _\n\n\t* President Trump has threatened to sue News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWS]) (NASDAQ:NWSA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWSA]) and its chairman emeritus, Rupert Murdoch, after The Wall Street Journal published a racy birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein that was allegedly written by Donald Trump. \n\n\u201cI told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn\u2019t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I\u2019m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper,\u201d Trump said Thursday night in a post on Truth Social, according to CNN [https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/media/trump-rupert-murdoch-wsj-epstein-story-lawsuit-threat].\n\n\u201cI look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his \u2018pile of garbage\u2019 newspaper, the WSJ,\" Trump said in another post on Friday.\n\nMurdoch is also the founder of Fox Corporation (FOX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOX]), which owns Fox News.\n\n\t* Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PARA]) (NASDAQ:PARAA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PARAA]) has canceled _The Late Show_ after 32 years on the air, citing financial reasons. The cancellation comes just days after host Stephen Colbert criticized Paramount for its $16 million settlement with Trump over a _60 Minutes_ interview with Kamala Harris.\n\n\"'THE LATE SHOW with STEPHEN COLBERT\u2019 will end its historic run in May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season. We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire THE LATE SHOW franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home,\" Paramount said in a statement [https://www.paramountpressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/releases/?view=111615-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-to-end-after-2025-26-broadcast-season].\n\n\"This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show\u2019s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,\" the company added.\n\n\t* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said the next Fed chair must have credibility with investors, adding that Trump has not reached out to him about taking the job. \n\n\u201cWhoever they choose, you\u2019re going to have to have somebody that has credibility with the markets,\u201d Waller said in an interview with Bloomberg TV [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/fed-s-waller-says-private-sector-job-worries-drive-rate-cut-call?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=Hh2p8mzs].\n\nHe added that if the next chair didn't have credibility, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see inflation expectations spike. You will not get lower interest rates. You will get higher interest rates.\"\n\nWaller has been considered a leading candidate to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.\n\n-Meanwhile, Powell responded to a letter sent by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought questioning management of a $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters.\n\n\"We take seriously the responsibility to be good stewards of public resources as we fulfill the duties given to us by Congress on behalf of the American people,\" Powell wrote in his letter, according to CNBC [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/powell-trump-vought-renovation.html].\n\n\"We have taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen since it was first approved by the Board [of Governors] in 2017. The project has been subject to budget approval each year by the Board members since then,\" Powell added.\n\nMORE ON NEWS, PARAMOUNT GLOBAL, ETC.\n\n \t* Consumers Continue To Power The Economy [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802208-consumers-continue-to-power-economy]\n \t* Brace For An Imminent Tariff-Related Shock, As August 1st Deadline Approaches [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802196-brace-for-an-imminent-tariff-related-shock-as-august-1st-deadline-approaches]\n \t* My Thoughts About Those June Retail Sales [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802166-thoughts-about-june-retail-sales]\n \t* Trump threatens to sue WSJ over Epstein story, clears DOJ to release grand jury testimony [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468735-trump-threatens-to-sue-wsj-over-epstein-story-clears-doj-to-release-grand-jury-testimony]\n \t* Fed\u2019s Waller pushes for July rate cut [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468709-feds-waller-pushes-for-july-rate-cut]\n\n ",

today gave up an early advance and turned lower as a -5% decline in Netflix weighed on technology stocks after the company forecasted below-consensus full-year operating margins.\u00a0 Also, the weakness in health insurance providers is weighing on the broader market today after Humana lost a lawsuit to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments and after Elevance Health was downgraded.\n\nStock indexes initially moved higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs.\u00a0 Bullish factors included the stronger-than-expected housing starts report and generally upbeat earnings reports.\u00a0 Also, the University of Michigan\u2019s US July consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to a 5-month high.\n\nFalling bond yields are supportive of stocks following dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday evening, who stated that he supports a Fed interest rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0 Also, an easing of

the July 5-10 year inflation expectations indicator eased to a 5-month low of +3.6%, weaker than expectations of +3.9%.\n\nThursday evening, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said, \u201cWith inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\u00a0 I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC\u2019s policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.\u201d\n\nRecent trade news has put some downward pressure on stocks.\u00a0 President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \u201cnot big countries who don\u2019t do that much business with the US.\u201d\n\nAlso, President Trump last weekend announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don\u2019t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 5% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on September 16-17.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week as big bank earnings results came in stronger than expected. \u00a0Early results now show S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +3.2% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.42%. \u00a0China\u2019s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.50%. \u00a0Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock 225 fell from a 2.5-week high and closed down -0.21%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) today are up +9 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -2.0 bp to 4.432%.\u00a0 T-notes are climbing today on dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who said he backs a Fed rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\u00a0 Also, falling inflation expectations in today\u2019s University of Michigan report were bullish for T-notes.\n\nOn the bearish side, today\u2019s US housing starts report was stronger than expected.\u00a0 Also, today\u2019s increase in the University of Michigan US July consumer sentiment to a 5-month high was negative for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is up +2.1 bp to 2.696%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1.5-month high of 4.680% and is up +2.1 bp to 4.676%.\n\nEurozone May construction output fell -1.7% m/m, the biggest decline in nearly 2.5-years.\n\nThe German June PPI fell -1.3% y/y, right on expectations and the steepest pace of decline in 9 months.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nWeakness in managed health care stocks is weighing on the broader market today.\u00a0Elevance Health

        "title": "Want $1 Million in Retirement? 4 Simple Index Funds to Buy and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Key Points\n\nU.S. large caps as a whole are reliable, but not necessarily the best, long-term performers. There\u2019s one sector in particular you can safely make a point of overweighting. Deglobalization is slowly but surely restoring the need for one category of stocks. 10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF \u203a\n\nPicking stocks can be a lot of fun. But it can also be constant work. The irony? The more active a portfolio is, the higher the odds of it underperforming. Something simpler and far more passive like buying and holding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the long haul is far more likely to build real wealth.\n\nTo this end, if you're ready to make such a strategic shift, here's a rundown of four complementary index ETFs that could make you a millionaire. You just need to be willing and able to leave them alone long enough to let them.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nStart with the basics\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this list starts with ETFs meant to mirror the S&P 500. It's the quintessential buy-and-hold equity investment. After all, this index reflects about 80% of the U.S. stock market's collective market capitalization and boasts a long-term average annual gain of about 10%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) or the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) are your easiest and most liquid choices here. Vanguard's version of the index fund is technically cheaper to own with an annual expense ratio of only 0.03%. But both are a cost-effective enough way of plugging into the index's long-term upside.\n\nYou can afford to be a little speculative\n\nExchange-traded funds don't exactly lend themselves to speculation -- at least not in the same way that investors speculate on individual stocks. But that doesn't mean you can't successfully use strategic exposure to certain kinds of ETFs.\n\nYou could deliberately hold an oversized stake in the technology sector via the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund(NYSEMKT: XLK) or a similar fund. After all, just as they have for the past three decades, technology companies are likely to introduce the most game-changing and lucrative innovations for the next 30 years.\n\nBut wouldn't the popular Invesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ: QQQ) do the job just as well, if not better? Maybe, but not necessarily.\n\nWhile it is true that the underlying Nasdaq-100 includes many of the market's best-performing technology tickers of the past several years (like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple), this may not always be the case. Remember, the Nasdaq-100 isn't inherently meant to be a technology index -- it just so happens that most of the market's top tech names right now are Nasdaq listings.\n\nAs time marches on and new companies grow bigger than the market's biggest players right now, these new titans might not be technology outfits, or even Nasdaq-listed names! They could be listed on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Since the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is specifically built to reflect the performance of the S&P 500's technology stocks, though, you'll be plugged into the tech sector no matter where these tickers are listed.\n\nWhile the Invesco QQQ Trust has produced some amazing gains since its launch back in 1999, it has also missed out on many technology companies' growth that got them there in the first place. By including the smaller tech names found within the S&P 500, you'll be invested at key periods of their growth.\n\nYou need international stocks more than you have in a long, long time\n\nDo you really need to own foreign stocks? It's a prudent question to begin asking again. International stocks were considered a must-have well before and a little after the turn of the century. Since then, though, so many U.S. companies have performed so consistently well and become so international on their own, there's been no meaningful benefit in specifically adding foreign exposure to your portfolio.\n\nBut now that pendulum seems to be swinging back in the other direction. With most nations starting to back off on their pro-international trade policies and refocusing more on domestic trade, we're seeing foreign nations and regions' economies -- and stock markets -- start to perform independently of U.S. stocks. And in many cases, they're performing better than their U.S. counterparts. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, for instance, believes worldwide GDP growth averages will roll in at 2.9% this year and next. The United States' GDP is expected to grow by only 1.6% this year, however, before slowing to a growth pace of 1.5% next year.\n\nIn this vein, foreign stocks have easily outperformed U.S. stocks so far this year largely because of these disparate outlooks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSure, the domestic economy might perk up in the foreseeable future. Or it might not. That's the point -- nobody knows. We only know enough to know a stake in something like the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF(NYSEMKT: IEFA) is a smart way of curbing some of the risk of betting on a less-than-certain U.S. economy.\n\nBetter than U.S. large caps\n\nFinally, if you want your best shot at becoming a millionaire using ETFs at the core of your portfolio, add an often-overlooked dimension to your holdings. That is, make a point of buying more U.S. mid-cap stocks. The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF(NYSEMKT: VO) meant to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Mid Cap Index will do the job nicely.\n\nDoes it really matter? Actually, it does. Given enough time, mid-cap stocks significantly outperform their large-cap counterparts. The S&P 400 Mid Cap Index, in fact, has nearly doubled the performance of the S&P 500 since the beginning of this century.\n\n^MID data by YCharts\n\nWhat gives? Mid-cap names are often in their sweet spot of growth -- past their wobbly start-up years, but not yet in their prime. Sometimes mid-cap companies are recent spinoffs from large-cap outfits that recognize the entity in question would be more valuable as a stand-alone company. Whatever the case, these names clearly pay off in the long run.\n\nThe only downside to consider here is that while these names collectively produce stronger gains, they also dish out for more volatility than large-cap stocks. You'll need to mentally plan on holding this mid-cap ETF for decades just to make these big swings bearable in the meantime.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $687,149!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,060,406!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,072% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 180% for the S&P 500.

        "title": "Should Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (VV) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF (VV), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/27/2004.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $43.08 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.17%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 34% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 6.80% of total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Apple Inc (AAPL).\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nVV seeks to match the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Index before fees and expenses. The CRSP US Large Cap Index includes U.S. companies that comprise the top 85% of investable market capitalization and are traded on NYSE, NYSE Market, NASDAQ or ARCA.\n\nThe ETF has added about 8.15% so far this year and was up about 14.79% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $228.25 and $289.94.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.25% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 479 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nVanguard Large-Cap ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VV is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) track a similar index. While SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $642.71 billion in assets, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has $693.52 billion. SPY has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VOO charges 0.03%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should First Trust Capital Strength ETF (FTCS) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the First Trust Capital Strength ETF (FTCS), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 07/06/2006.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $8.36 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.52%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.22%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 23.90% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Staples round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) accounts for about 2.45% of total assets, followed by Te Connectivity Plc (TEL) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 22.34% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nFTCS seeks to match the performance of the The Capital Strength Index before fees and expenses. The Capital Strength Index is an equal-dollar weighted index which provides exposure to well-capitalized companies with strong market positions based on strong balance sheets, high degree of liquidity, ability to generate earnings growth & record financial strength & profit growth.\n\nThe ETF has added roughly 4.12% so far this year and was up about 6.13% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $81.60 and $94.03.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.80 and standard deviation of 12.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 51 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlternatives\n\nFirst Trust Capital Strength ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FTCS is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) track a similar index. While SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $642.71 billion in assets, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has $693.52 billion. SPY has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VOO charges 0.03%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Fed\u2019s Waller pushes for July rate cut",
        "content": "[Senate Banking Committee Hears Testimony From Nominees For Federal Reserve Board Of Governors]\nSarah Silbiger\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said policymakers should cut interest rates this month to support a labor market that is showing signs of weakness.\n\n\u201cWith inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate,\u201d he said Thursday in the text of a speech prepared for an event hosted by the Money Marketeers in New York. \u201cI believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC\u2019s policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. central bank held its policy rate steady at the 4.25%-4.50% target range for a fourth straight meeting in June. The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for July 29-30.\n\n\u201cI see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks to the (Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s) employment mandate have increased,\u201d and that justifies cutting rates, Waller added.\n\nWaller is one of two officials backing a rate cut in July, arguing that the recent import tax spike is likely a one-off event that policymakers can look past. He said the Fed no longer needs a restrictive stance, with its benchmark rate well above the 3% long-run neutral level.\n\nIf inflation stays subdued and expectations of future price increases remain anchored, Waller said he would \u201csupport further 25 basis point cuts to move monetary policy toward neutral,\u201d he said.\n\nWaller also warned that holding off on easing this month could pose risks later. The Fed last cut rates in December 2024.\n\nTo track the U.S. economy using ETFs, investors can consider broad market ETFs: (SP500 [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500]), (NYSEARCA:SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]), (NYSEARCA:VOO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO]), (NYSEARCA:IVV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV]), (NYSEARCA:RSP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP]), (NYSEARCA:SSO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSO]), (NYSEARCA:UPRO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO]), (NYSEARCA:SH [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH]), (NYSEARCA:SDS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDS]), and (NYSEARCA:SPXU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPXU]).\n\nMORE ON RELATED ETFS\n\n \t* Tariffs, Schmarriffs [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802119-tariffs-schmarriffs]\n \t* Evidence That The Banking System Is In Strong Shape [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801942-evidence-that-the-banking-system-is-in-strong-shape]\n \t* AAII Sentiment Survey: Pessimism Pushes Through [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802018-aaii-sentiment-survey-pessimism-pushes-through]\n \t* S&P 500, Nasdaq notch record closes as retail sales and earnings fuel rally [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468473-stock-market-news-today-nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones]\n \t* Potential Powell heir Warsh calls Fed independence 'essential' and touts regime change [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468456-potential-powell-heir-warsh-calls-fed-independence-essential-and-touts-regime-change]\n\n ",

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) Thursday closed up +0.54%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI)\u00a0(DIA) closed up +0.52%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.74%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.59%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.77%.\n\nStocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes posting new record highs.\u00a0 Signs that the US economy is holding up, despite tariff uncertainty, boosted stocks. \u00a0Positive economic news Thursday included a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 3-month low, a stronger-than-expected retail sales report, and a rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to a 5-month high.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks added to their gains Thursday afternoon on dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said the most recent set of rate projections from Fed officials, issued in June, offered a \"reasonable outlook\" in pointing to two 25 bp rate cuts by year's end.\u00a0 She added that the Fed should not wait too long before moving on rates, because if they wait until inflation is 2%, they've \"likely injured the economy in some way that was completely unnecessary.\"\n\nOn the negative side, health insurers retreated on Thursday, led by a -12% plunge in Elevance Health after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year.\u00a0 Also, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler were bearish for stocks when she said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold \"for some time,\" citing accelerating inflation as tariffs start to boost prices.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -7,000 to a 3-month low of 221,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 233,000.\n\nUS June retail sales rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m, and June retail sales ex-autos rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.\n\nThe US June import price index ex-petroleum was unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose +19.9 to a 5-month high of 15.9, stronger than expectations of -1.0.\n\nThe US July NAHB housing market index rose +1 to 33, right on expectations.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, signs that the US could ease some of its export restrictions on semiconductor chips to China are bullish for chip makers.\u00a0 Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Nvidia could soon resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China, and Advanced Micro Devices received similar assurances from the Commerce Department, a sign that the US may be in the process of negotiating a grand trade deal with China.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, within \"the next couple of weeks\" and signaled the US will likely extend an August 12 deadline for the easing of sky-high tariffs.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on September 16-17.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.6% m/m to 1.300 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.5% m/m to 1.387 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Thursday settled higher.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +1.49%. \u00a0China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Thursday closed down -3.5 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield rose +0.8 bp to 4.463%.\u00a0 T-notes on Thursday posted modest losses following stronger-than-expected US economic news, including June retail sales, weekly initial unemployment claims, and the July Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which signaled a hawkish tone for Fed policy.\u00a0 Also, Thursday's rally in the S&P 500 to a new all-time high reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes. \u00a0In addition, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler weighed on T-notes when she said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold \"for some time.\" Finally, rising inflation expectations undercut T-notes when the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 4.75-month high of 2.450% on Thursday.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited Thursday on carryover support from late Wednesday when President Trump said he has \"no plans\" on firing Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0T-notes also found support on signs of easing price pressures after Thursday's news showed the June import price index ex-petroleum rose less than expected.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Thursday were mixed.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.3 bp to 2.675%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 6-week high of 4.678% and finished up +1.7 bp to 4.655%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL) closed up more than +3% to lead airline stocks higher after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable and the company has potential \"upside\" to beat its earnings targets as customers returned to booking flights.\u00a0 Also, Alaska Air Group (ALK) closed up more than +3% and American Airlines Group (AAL) closed up more than +2%.\u00a0 In addition, Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed up more than +1%.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) closed up more than +7% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 net revenue of $22.73 billion, above the consensus of $22.32 billion.\n\nSnap-on (SNA) closed up more than +7% after reporting Q2 net sales of $1.18 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.16 billion.\n\nSteven Madden Ltd (SHOO) closed up more than +6% after Citigroup upgraded the stock to buy from neutral with a price target of $32.\n\nCSX Corp (CSX) closed up more than +4% after Semafor reported that Union Pacific is exploring an acquisition of the company.\n\nTravelers Cos (TRV) closed up more than +3% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials after reporting Q1 core EPS of $6.51, well above the consensus of $3.60.\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ) closed up more than +3% after Jefferies upgraded the stock to buy from hold with a price target of $78.\n\nHealth insurance providers are sliding today, led by a -12% plunge in Elevance Health (ELV) to lead losers in the S&P 500 after cutting its earnings outlook for the year\u00a0to \"approximately\" $30 per share, well below a previous forecast of $34.15 to $34.85 per share.\u00a0 Also, Molina Healthcare (MOH) closed down more than -5% and Centene (CNC) closed down more than -4%.\u00a0 In addition, Cigna Group (CI) closed down more than -2% and Humana (HUM) closed down more than -1%.\u00a0 Finally, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) closed down more than -1% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials.\n\nSonic Automotive (SAH) closed down -10% after JPMorgan Chase downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight with a price target of $72.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) closed down more than -8% after reporting Q2 organic sales of +6.90%, below the consensus of +7.03% and forecasting full-year organic sales of +6% to +7%, weaker than the consensus of +7.37%.\n\nStarwood Property Trust (STWD) closed down more than -5% after selling over 25.5 million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering overnight between $19.91 to $20.33 a share, below Wednesday's closing price of $20.85.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) closed down more than -1% after Jeffries downgraded the stock to underperform from hold with a price target of $120.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) closed down -1% after Leerink Partners downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform.\n\nEarnings Reports (7/18/2025)\n\n3M Co (MMM), Ally

        "content": "The early Q2 earnings results, mostly from the Finance sector, have been better than expected. Most of these banks and brokers are not only easily beating consensus estimates, but also providing a favorable outlook for the coming periods.\n\nSince\u00a0 banks are an economically sensitive sector whose operations touch all types of consumers and businesses, this favorable view of underlying business trends by the banks provides a reassuring read-through for the rest of the Q2 earnings season.\n\nEstimates for Q2 had come under severe pressure after the quarter got underway, with the announcement of reciprocal tariffs in early April prompting analysts to materially lower their earnings expectations.\n\nThe revisions trend stabilized later in the quarter, with estimates for the Tech sector actually nudging up after coming down earlier in the quarter. Estimates had actually modestly gone up for three sectors \u2013 Consumer Discretionary, Utilities and Aerospace.\n\nOf these three sectors, the favorable revisions trend for the Utilities sector is tied to improving demand trends as a result of AI related demand from datacenters while the positive revisions trend for the Consumer Discretionary sector is solely due to favorable revisions for media players like Disney DIS, Netflix NFLX and others.\n\nThe magnitude of negative revisions to Q2 estimates has been bigger than most other post-Covid periods. This suggests to us that the bar is likely low enough that companies will easily jump through them. But more than companies\u2019 ability to beat consensus Q2 estimates, it will company guidance for Q3 and beyond that will determine the market reaction to the results.\n\nFor more details about the Q2 earnings season and expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Off Positively: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the first half of the year, investors poured $540 billion of new money into exchange-traded funds, and firms launched 464 new ETFs, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nSome of the research firm\u2019s ETF predictions for 2025 have already come to fruition, including active ETFs outnumbering their passive counterparts and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) surpassing the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as the world\u2019s largest ETF.\n\nBut in the second half of the year, Zachary Evens, a manager research analyst for Morningstar, told etf.com that public-private ETFs, ETF share classes and even more active ETFs are the trends to watch.\n\nGrowing Comfortability with Private Asset ETFs, PRIV\n\nA major discussion in the ETF space centers on the arrival of private market investing. State Street and Apollo Global Management introduced the SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) in February\u2014a first-of-its-kind private credit ETF. The fund has $139.4 million in assets under management and, while flows were initially muted, they\u2019ve since picked up. State Street filed for another private credit ETF, the SPDR SSGA Short Duration IG Public & Private Credit ETF, in May.\n\nEvens said he thinks investors will slowly become more comfortable with these relatively illiquid securities in such liquid vehicles as the ETFs establish track records and gain assets.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we get more transparency also on what's going on behind the scenes to make investors comfortable\u2014that the ETF is delivering what it says it delivers,\u201d he added.\n\nPotential Approval of ETF Share Classes\n\nETF share classes haven\u2019t been approved yet, but Evens expects that will change in the latter half of the year. Firms like Thornburg Investment Management are already seeking approval to offer these ETF/mutual fund hybrid structures.\n\n\u201cWhen that's approved, there should be a lot happening in the space,\u201d Evens said, adding that it\u2019s unclear whether the SEC will approve filings one by one or in a batch. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how fund companies react and how quickly they're able to attach those share classes to their existing mutual funds.\u201d\n\nMore Active ETFs\n\nBy the end of the first half of the year, there were 2,226 active ETFs and 2,157 passive ETFs on the market. Evans said the acceleration of active ETFs is a trend investors should continue to watch in the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cActive ETFs only make up about 10% of the ETF universe, so despite having more active ETFs than passive ETFs, they still claim relatively little market share in the whole ETF universe,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see not just in the second half of this year but in years to come if assets will continue to gravitate towards active ETFs and if they can take out a meaningful chunk in passive ETFs\u2019 lead on the market share side.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added that a lot of the growth has been in the less traditional active space. But more fund companies are launching more traditional discretionary actively managed funds, and there has been a select success among firms that have tried that path, so a trend to watch is whether more traditional active strategies in the ETF wrapper can achieve sustained success.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2025 etf.com.

Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview])\u00a0(DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) closed up +0.52%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) closed up +0.74%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) rose +0.59%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) rose +0.77%.\n\nStocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes posting new record highs.\u00a0 Signs that the US economy is holding up, despite tariff uncertainty, boosted stocks. \u00a0Positive economic news Thursday included a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 3-month low, a stronger-than-expected retail sales report, and a rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to a 5-month high.\n\nStocks added to their gains Thursday afternoon on dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said the most recent set of rate projections from Fed officials, issued in June, offered a \"reasonable outlook\" in pointing to two 25 bp rate cuts by year's end.\u00a0 She added that the Fed should not wait too long before moving on rates, because if they wait until inflation is 2%, they've \"likely injured the economy in some way that was completely unnecessary.\"\n\nOn the negative side, health insurers retreated on Thursday, led by a -12% plunge in Elevance Health after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year.\u00a0 Also, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler were bearish for stocks when she said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold \"for some time,\" citing accelerating inflation as tariffs start to boost prices.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -7,000 to a 3-month low of 221,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 233,000.\n\nUS June retail sales rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m, and June retail sales ex-autos rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.\n\nThe US June import price index ex-petroleum was unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose +19.9 to a 5-month high of 15.9, stronger than expectations of -1.0.\n\nThe US July NAHB housing market index rose +1 to 33, right on expectations.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, signs that the US could ease some of its export restrictions on semiconductor chips to China are bullish for chip makers.\u00a0 Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Nvidia could soon resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China, and Advanced Micro Devices received similar assurances from the Commerce Department, a sign that the US may be in the process of negotiating a grand trade deal with China.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, within \"the next couple of weeks\" and signaled the US will likely extend an August 12 deadline for the easing of sky-high tariffs.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on September 16-17.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.6% m/m to 1.300 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.5% m/m to 1.387 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets on Thursday settled higher.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +1.49%. \u00a0China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) on Thursday closed down -3.5 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield rose +0.8 bp to 4.463%.\u00a0 T-notes on Thursday posted modest losses following stronger-than-expected US economic news, including June retail sales, weekly initial unemployment claims, and the July Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which signaled a hawkish tone for Fed policy.\u00a0 Also, Thursday's rally in the S&P 500 to a new all-time high reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes. \u00a0In addition, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler weighed on T-notes when she said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold \"for some time.\" Finally, rising inflation expectations undercut T-notes when the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 4.75-month high of 2.450% on Thursday.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited Thursday on carryover support from late Wednesday when President Trump said he has \"no plans\" on firing Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0T-notes also found support on signs of easing price pressures after Thursday's news showed the June import price index ex-petroleum rose less than expected.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Thursday were mixed.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.3 bp to 2.675%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 6-week high of 4.678% and finished up +1.7 bp to 4.655%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UAL/overview]) closed up more than +3% to lead airline stocks higher after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable and the company has potential \"upside\" to beat its earnings targets as customers returned to booking flights.\u00a0 Also, Alaska Air Group (ALK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ALK/overview]) closed

        "content": "New York, USA, July 17th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nIn a live financial television interview, Streamex CEO Henry McPhie unveiled new details surrounding the company\u2019s strategic merger with BioSig Technologies (NASDAQ: BSGM), which officially positions Streamex as one of the first publicly traded real-world asset (RWA) tokenization companies focused on the $142 trillion commodities market.\n\nThe interview aired just days after the highly anticipated Circle IPO, which McPhie noted has signaled a \u201cvery bullish market for crypto-related stocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to get to the market even before the Circle IPO,\u201d said McPhie. \u201cWith our merger with BSGM, we\u2019ve brought Streamex to the Nasdaq, allowing us to deliver a truly innovative public vehicle for commodities tokenization.\u201d\n\nThe newly merged entity aims to bring real-world commodities on-chain through financial products tailored specifically to the unique dynamics of the sector. According to McPhie, the company\u2019s mission centers on the democratization of capital and efficiency of assets \u2014 two core principles enabled by blockchain tokenization.\n\n\u201cWith tokenization, we can create financial instruments that don\u2019t exist today in the commodity space,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s about unlocking value, liquidity, and access.\u201d\n\nBacking this mission are key industry veterans now serving as advisors, including:\n\nShaun Rosen, founder of what was once North America\u2019s largest mining operation (Osoco Mining) Frank Giustra, a serial entrepreneur who has built multiple companies exceeding $50 billion in combined valuation\n\nStreamex is fully regulated in Canada and is actively pursuing U.S. broker-dealer registration to further solidify its presence in North America\u2019s financial markets.\n\n\u201cAs a first mover in this space, we're paving the path for commodity tokenization to go mainstream \u2014 bringing novel, efficient assets to public investors,\u201d said McPhie.\n\nAbout Streamex\n\nStreamex is building the future of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with a focus on commodities and hard assets.

        "content": "San Francisco, CA, July 17th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nCrowdsourced Hedge Fund Announces Strategic Token Buyback as Meta Model Leads Amid AUM Growth\n\nNumerai, the decentralized hedge fund powered by crowdsourced machine learning, today announced plans to buy back $1 million of its token, Numeraire (NMR), from the open market. The buyback reflects Numerai\u2019s continued investment in its staking ecosystem, a mechanism that aligns thousands of global data scientists with the long-term performance of its hedge fund.\n\nOver the past year, Numerai has more than doubled its assets under management (AUM), growing from approximately $173 million to over $441 million. The fund now trades more than $1 billion per month across over 30 global markets, relying on machine learning models crowdsourced from a global network of data scientists who stake NMR on their predictions.\n\nEach week, thousands of data scientists submit predictions to Numerai\u2019s tournament and stake NMR on their models' performance. These stakes encourage aligned, high-quality contributions to the hedge fund, and it\u2019s working. Numerai\u2019s Stake-Weighted Meta Model, an ensemble of user models weighted by their NMR staked, has consistently outperformed individual models, reinforcing Numerai\u2019s incentive-aligned approach to collective intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe success of our Stake-Weighted Meta Model speaks for itself: it\u2019s outperformed every individual model over the past year. As our AUM grows and top institutional allocators join us, the role of NMR has never been more critical,\" said Richard Craib, Founder and CEO of Numerai.\n\nBut as Numerai\u2019s ecosystem has matured, NMR has become scarce. With a fixed supply capped at 11 million, and roughly 3 million NMR remaining in Numerai\u2019s treasury, the company has limited capacity to continue distributing staking rewards at historical levels. The company says the buyback will help underscore its long-term commitment to its participants and maintain economic stability.\n\nThe buyback will be executed gradually to ensure transparency. Orders will be placed at or near prevailing bid prices, allowing the program to unfold gradually over time. The full explanation behind the buyback can be found on Numerai\u2019s newly launched blog.\n\nAbout Numerai\n\nFounded in 2015, Numerai is a San Francisco-based hedge fund that crowdsources stock market predictions to solve the hardest problem in finance. The fund is powered by thousands of data scientists globally who can stake NMR on their models and contribute to a crowdsourced Meta Model used in live trading.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDiscord | X | Docs\n\nContact\n\nPress Contact\r\nLindsay Smith\r\nNumerai\r\nlindsay@numer.ai\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is up +0.30%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI)\u00a0(DIA) is up +0.35%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.40%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.08%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.18%.\n\nStocks are climbing today on signs the US economy is holding up, despite tariff uncertainty. \u00a0Positive economic news today included a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 3-month low, a stronger-than-expected retail sales report, and a rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to a 5-month high.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStrength in airline stocks is also lifting the broader market as United Airlines Holdings jumped more than +6% after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable, and the company has potential \"upside\" to beat its earnings targets as customers returned to booking flights.\n\nOn the negative side, health insurers are retreating today, led by an -11% plunge in Elevance Health after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -7,000 to a 3-month low of 221,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 233,000.\n\nUS June retail sales rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m, and June retail sales ex-autos rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.\n\nThe US June import price index ex-petroleum was unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose +19.9 to a 5-month high of 15.9, stronger than expectations of -1.0.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, signs that the US could ease some of its export restrictions on semiconductor chips to China are bullish for chip makers.\u00a0 Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Nvidia could soon resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China, and Advanced Micro Devices received similar assurances from the Commerce Department, a sign that the US may be in the process of negotiating a grand trade deal with China.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, within \"the next couple of weeks\" and signaled the US will likely extend an August 12 deadline for the easing of sky-high tariffs.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 Later today, the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are higher.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is up +1.11%.\u00a0 China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +4 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -2.2 bp to 4.433%.\u00a0 T-notes recovered from early losses today and moved higher on carryover support from late Wednesday when President Trump said he has \"no plans\u201d on firing Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 T-notes also found support on signs of easing price pressures after today's news showed the Jun import price index ex-petroleum rose less than expected.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower today on stronger-than-expected US economic news, including June retail sales, weekly initial unemployment claims, and the July Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which signaled strength in the US economy that was hawkish for Fed policy.\u00a0 Also, strength in stocks today has reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.4 bp to 2.691%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 6-week high of 4.678% and is up +2.2 bp to 4.660%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL) is up more than +6% to lead airline stocks higher after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable and

public offering of its common stock to fund its expansion.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM) is down more than -1% after President Trump said Coca-Cola has agreed to use \"real cane sugar\" in Coke soda

A 2025 survey found that 89% of high-net-worth crypto investors plan to increase their digital-asset exposure this year, reflecting widespread confidence in this asset class. These developments, Alex says, validate his focus on disciplined crypto exposure for wealth growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Vision\n\nAlex\u2019s investment philosophy centers on patience, education and alignment with client goals. He often reminds clients to \u201ctrust the process\u201d \u2013 meaning to follow a well-researched strategy even during market swings. \u201cTrusting the investment process is essential,\u201d Melnyk says. \u201cBy remaining patient and disciplined, investors give their strategies time to succeed.\u201d This perspective comes from years of navigating bull and bear markets. He encourages clients to stay focused on fundamentals (like network security and adoption trends) rather than short-term noise.\n\nAnother core belief is making capital work proactively. \u201cOur goal is to make your money work for you,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe align every decision with your financial goals to build lasting wealth.\u201d In practice, Alex customizes each portfolio strategy to reflect individual risk tolerance and horizons. He believes education is key: clients who understand how crypto markets function will invest with confidence. That aligns with broader trends \u2013 investors today want advisors who are both risk managers and educators. Alex positions himself as a strategic partner who builds trust through knowledge and transparent communication, exactly what many affluent clients demand.\n\nBy combining world-class credentials with a client-first approach, Alex Melnyk has earned the admiration and trust of Virturo\u2019s clients.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) today is up +0.25%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview])\u00a0(DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) is up +0.19%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) is up +0.47%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) are up +0.25%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) are up +0.51%.\n\nStocks are climbing today on signs the US economy is holding up, despite tariff uncertainty. \u00a0Positive economic news today included a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 3-month low, a stronger-than-expected retail sales report, and a rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to a 5-month high.\n\nStrength in airline stocks is also lifting the broader market, as United Airlines Holdings jumped more than 3% after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable and the company has potential \u201cupside\u201d to beat its earnings targets, as customers return to booking flights.\u00a0\n\nOn the negative side, health insurers are retreating today, led by an -11% plunge in Elevance Health after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year.\u00a0Also, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler were bearish for stocks when she said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold \u201cfor some time,\u201d citing accelerating inflation as tariffs start to boost prices.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -7,000 to a 3-month low of 221,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 233,000.\n\nUS June retail sales rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m, and June retail sales ex-autos rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.\n\nThe US June import price index ex-petroleum was unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose +19.9 to a 5-month high of 15.9, stronger than expectations of -1.0.\n\nThe US July NAHB housing market index rose +1 to 33, right on expectations.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \u201cnot big countries who don\u2019t do that much business with the US.\u201d\n\nAlso, signs that the US could ease some of its export restrictions on semiconductor chips to China are bullish for chip makers.\u00a0 Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Nvidia could soon resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China, and Advanced Micro Devices received similar assurances from the Commerce Department, a sign that the US may be in the process of negotiating a grand trade deal with China.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, within \u201cthe next couple of weeks\u201d and signaled the US will likely extend an August 12 deadline for the easing of sky-high tariffs.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don\u2019t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 Later today, the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan\u2019s US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets today are higher.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is up +1.23%. \u00a0China\u2019s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. \u00a0Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) today are up +3 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -2.4 bp to 4.431%.\u00a0 T-notes recovered from early losses today and moved higher on carryover support from late Wednesday when President Trump said he has \u201cno plans\u201d on firing Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 T-notes also found support on signs of easing price pressures after today\u2019s news showed the June import price index ex-petroleum rose less than expected.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower today on stronger-than-expected US economic news, including June retail sales, weekly initial unemployment claims, and the July Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which signaled strength in the US economy that was hawkish for Fed policy.\u00a0 Also, strength in stocks today has reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes. \u00a0In addition, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler limited gains in T-notes when she said the Fed should keep interest rate on hold \u201cfor some time.\u201d\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving lower.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is down -2.0 bp to 2.667%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 6-week high of 4.678% and is down -0.1 bp to 4.638%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UAL/overview]) is up more than +3% to lead airline stocks higher after CEO Kirby said the

Uber and Lucid plan to launch the robotaxi service next year.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the investment will be worth around $300 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world,\u201d said Uber (NYSE:UBER [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER]) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement [https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20169482-lucid-nuro-and-uber-partner-on-next-generation-autonomous-robotaxi-program].\n\n\"This investment from Uber further validates Lucid's fully redundant zonal architecture and highly capable platform as ideal for autonomous vehicles, and our industry-leading range and spacious, well-appointed interiors, as ideal for ridesharing,\" said Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCID]) interim CEO Marc Winterhoff in the same statement. \"This is the start of our path to extend our innovation and technology leadership into this multi-trillion-dollar market.\"\n\nUber (UBER [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER]) also has a robotaxi partnership with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG]) (NASDAQ:GOOGL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL]) Waymo.\n\n\t* Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is believed to be a leading candidate to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, is calling for \"regime change\" at the central bank.\n\n\u201cWe need regime change in the conduct of policy,\u201d Warsh said during an interview with CNBC [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/kevin-warsh-touts-regime-change-at-fed-and-calls-for-partnership-with-treasury.html] on Thursday. \u201cThe credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view.\u201d\n\nWarsh also indicated that he would be at odds with several of the Federal Reserve governors if he were to become chair.\n\n\u201cTheir hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a quite a mark against them,\u201d Warsh said during the interview. \u201cThe specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them.

        "title": "Good News for GE, Jobless Claims, Retail Sales &amp; More",
        "content": "Thursday, July 17, 2025\r\n\r\nThe biggest day of the week for economic reports and Q2 earnings is upon us. In fact, there is so much data in front of us, we should be able to fill this column with just the numbers. Pre-market futures were mixed but are now positive across the board: +30 points on the Dow, +10 on the S&P 500 and +70 points on the Nasdaq. Bond yields continue to creep up: +4.49% on the 10-year, +3.94% on the 2-year and +5.04% on the 30-year yield.\n\nA Cavalcade of Economic Results: Jobless Claims Healthy\n\nStarting as we do most Thursday mornings, Initial Jobless Claims are out: down for the fifth week in a row from near-term highs, 221K new jobless claims are the lowest we\u2019ve seen since mid-April, far below the 234K estimate and well off the June high of 250K. What looked on the graph to be a steady incline of new jobless claims through the first half of the year has now shifted downward in a big way. This is very strong news for the labor market.\r\n\r\nContinuing Claims, on the other hand, ticked up slightly once again: 1.956 million, from 1.954 million the prior week (these numbers are reported a week in arrears from Initial Claims), remaining just shy of the psychological 2 million mark, where we haven\u2019t been since late 2021. This is the eighth straight week above 1.9 million longer-term jobless claims, and the 9th of the last 12. Yet with new claims pitching downward as they are, perhaps we\u2019ll postpone this reunion with 2 million claims for a longer time.\n\nRetail Sales Robust for June\n\nAdvanced Retail Sales for June (\u201dadvanced,\u201d meaning subject to revision in a couple weeks) tripled expectations this morning to +0.6%, turning around in a startling manner from -0.9% reported for May. This is the second-highest Retail Sales print of 2025 since March posted +1.5%; in fact, these are the only two positive months of the year so far.\r\n\r\nBeneath the headline, everything came in ahead of expectations, as well: ex-Autos reached +0.5%, ex-Autos & Gasoline +0.6%, and the Control number \u2014 which gets fed up the food chain of economic data such as Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), the (current) Fed\u2019s preferred metric on inflation \u2014 is +0.5%. This equals March\u2019s +0.5% Control number, as well.\n\nImport & Export Prices Moderate\n\nMore good news: Import Prices came in lower than expected: +0.1%, but up from a big downward revision of -0.4% of the previous month. Ex-petrol (fuel), this number moderates further, to 0.0%. Year-over-year Import Prices have now swung to a negative -0.2% from an anticipated +0.3%. More easing on imported goods \u2014 counter to expectations.\r\n\r\nExport Prices month over month came in at +0.5%, the highest level since pre-tariff pull-forwards in February, whereas year over year we\u2019re at the highest level since January: +2.8%. Any time we can see import prices moderate but exports improve, that\u2019s got to be a good (near-term) sign for the domestic economy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPhilly Fed Blossoms to Start the Summer\n\nAnother metric posting its first positive month since March, the Philly Fed manufacturing survey, sprung ahead to 15.9 in June, up strongly from the -4 posted for May. In fact, this is the highest print since February\u2019s 18.0, and provides a positive narrative for regional manufacturing in the region of the sixth-largest city in the U.S.\n\nGE Outpaces Estimates in Q2 Earnings\n\nGE Aerospace GE, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated stock going into this morning\u2019s earnings report, soundly beat Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning: earnings of $1.66 per share was well ahead of the projected $1.43 and the $1.20 per share reported in the year-ago quarter, for a positive surprise of +16%. Revenues of $10.15 billion beat estimates by +5.12%. Shares are up +1.3% at this hour, now a whopping +60% year to date.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) today is up +0.30%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview])\u00a0(DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) is up +0.35%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) is up +0.40%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) are up +0.08%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) are up +0.18%.\n\nStocks are climbing today on signs the US economy is holding up, despite tariff uncertainty. \u00a0Positive economic news today included a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 3-month low, a stronger-than-expected retail sales report, and a rise in the Philadelphia Fed index to a 5-month high.\n\nStrength in airline stocks is also lifting the broader market as United Airlines Holdings jumped more than +6% after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable, and the company has potential \"upside\" to beat its earnings targets as customers returned to booking flights.\u00a0\n\nOn the negative side, health insurers are retreating today, led by an -11% plunge in Elevance Health after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year.\n\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -7,000 to a 3-month low of 221,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 233,000.\n\nUS June retail sales rose +0.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m, and June retail sales ex-autos rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.\n\nThe US June import price index ex-petroleum was unchanged m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m.\n\nThe US July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose +19.9 to a 5-month high of 15.9, stronger than expectations of -1.0.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said late Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10% or 15%, effective August 1, and that the group was \"not big countries who don't do that much business with the US.\"\n\nAlso, signs that the US could ease some of its export restrictions on semiconductor chips to China are bullish for chip makers.\u00a0 Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Nvidia could soon resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China, and Advanced Micro Devices received similar assurances from the Commerce Department, a sign that the US may be in the process of negotiating a grand trade deal with China.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Bessent is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, within \"the next couple of weeks\" and signaled the US will likely extend an August 12 deadline for the easing of sky-high tariffs.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 Later today, the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets today are higher.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is up +1.11%.\u00a0 China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) today are up +4 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -2.2 bp to 4.433%.\u00a0 T-notes recovered from early losses today and moved higher on carryover support from late Wednesday when President Trump said he has \"no plans\u201d on firing Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 T-notes also found support on signs of easing price pressures after today's news showed the Jun import price index ex-petroleum rose less than expected.\n\nT-notes initially moved lower today on stronger-than-expected US economic news, including June retail sales, weekly initial unemployment claims, and the July Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, which signaled strength in the US economy that was hawkish for Fed policy.\u00a0 Also, strength in stocks today has reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes.\u00a0\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.4 bp to 2.691%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 6-week high of 4.678% and is up +2.2 bp to 4.660%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UAL/overview]) is up more than +6% to lead airline stocks higher after CEO Kirby said the second half of the year has become more predictable and the company has potential \"upside\" to beat its earnings targets as customers

lead losers in the Dow Joens Industrials.\n\nSonic Automotive (SAH [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SAH/overview]) is down more than -6% after JPMorgan Chase downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight with a price target of $72.\n\nStarwood Property Trust (STWD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/STWD/overview]) is down more than -4% after selling over 25.5 million shares of its

expansion.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ADM/overview]) is down more than -1% after President Trump said Coca-Cola has agreed to use \"real cane sugar\" in Coke soda in the US, which could reduce demand for ADM's corn syrup and hurt its corn-processing business.\u00a0\n\nShake Shack (SHAK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SHAK/overview]) is down more than -1% after Jeffries downgraded the stock to underperform from hold with a price target of $120.\n\nEARNINGS REPORTS (7/17/2025)\n\nPepsiCo Inc (PEP), Travelers Cos Inc/The (TRV), Abbott

        "content": "[USA and China flags]\nIgorIgorevich\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly dialed down his confrontational tone with China to secure a summit with counterpart Xi Jinping and a trade deal with the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nTrump is now focused on cutting purchase deals with Beijing similar to one he forged during his first term and celebrating quick wins instead of addressing the root causes of the trade imbalances, _Bloomberg _reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. president said he would be fighting China \u201cin a very friendly fashion.\u201d\n\nIn meetings with his staff, Trump is often the least hawkish voice in the room, some people familiar with internal deliberations said.\n\nAdministration officials emphasized that Trump has consistently expressed personal admiration for Xi, but noted that during his first term, he still imposed broad restrictions on Huawei Technologies and levied tariffs on most Chinese exports.\n\nThe decision to allow Nvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]) to resume sales [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467757-nvidia-to-ramp-up-h20-chip-supply-bring-advanced-chips-to-china] of its less-advanced, China-focused H20 chip \u2014 despite earlier statements from multiple senior officials that this was off the table \u2014 marked a reversal of the administration\u2019s previously stated policy to restrict Beijing\u2019s access to key American technologies.\n\nIn a further effort to ease tensions, US officials are preparing to delay an Aug. 12 deadline when U.S. tariffs on China are set to snap back to 145% after the expiration of a 90-day truce. Bessent signaled in a _Bloomberg Television_ interview this week that the deadline was flexible.\n\nOne person familiar with the plans said the tariff truce could be extended another three months. This comes as Trump is rolling out duties for other countries, including key allies.\n\nChina ETFs: (KWEB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KWEB]), (NASDAQ:PGJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGJ]), (NYSEARCA:FXI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXI]), (NYSEARCA:ASHR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASHR]), (YIN), (NYSEARCA:YANG [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YANG]), (NYSEARCA:GXC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GXC]), (FXP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXP]), (NYSEARCA:KBA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBA]), (CXSE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXSE]), (CNYA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNYA]), (CHAU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHAU]), (FLCH [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLCH]), (YXI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YXI]), (FCA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCA]), (KALL), (JCHI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JCHI])\n\nETFs to track the S&P (SP500 [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500]): (NYSEARCA:SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]), (VOO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO]), (IVV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV]), (RSP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP]), (SSO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSO]), (UPRO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO]), (SH [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH]), (SDS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDS]), and (SPXU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPXU]).\n\nMORE ON MARKETS, ETC.\n\n \t* The Latest Tariffs Are Likely To Stick [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801753-latest-tariffs-are-likely-to-stick]\n \t* If Trump Fires Powell, Here's The Tsunami It Would Create In The Markets [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801740-if-trump-fires-powell-heres-the-tsunami-it-would-create-in-the-markets]\n \t* Why The Recent Rally Has Me Worried [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801658-why-the-recent-rally-has-me-worried]\n\n ",

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed up +0.29%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI)\u00a0(DIA) closed up +0.47%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.12%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.33%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) closed up +0.11%.\n\nStocks ended the day higher after President Trump denied that he intends to summarily fire Fed Chair Powell, although he left open the possibility of firing him for cause.\u00a0Stocks temporarily dropped during midday after reports circulated that Mr. Trump had told Republican House members that he met with on Tuesday that he wanted to fire Mr. Powell.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks found support early in the session on the soft PPI report, which was dovish for Fed policy.\u00a0 Stocks also found support after the 10-year T-note yield ended the day down -3 bp.\u00a0The afternoon Beige Book report was supportive of stocks, as it indicated a small improvement in economic activity compared to the previous report.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index was undercut by weakness in chip stocks after ASML's disappointing guidance, although some chip stocks recovered later in the day.\n\nWednesday's June PPI report was favorable, as both the month-over-month and year-over-year figures were better than expected, suggesting that tariff inflation has not yet hit the producer level.\u00a0 The PPI report sparked some inflation optimism after Tuesday's mixed CPI report.\n\nSpecifically, the June final-demand PPI was unchanged m/m and +2.3% y/y, which was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y.\u00a0 The June core PPI report of unchanged m/m and +2.6% y/y was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.6% y/y. \u00a0The year-over-year figures of +2.3% (nominal) and +2.6% y/y (core) were down from the revised May figures of +2.7% and +3.2%, respectively.\n\nWednesday's June US industrial production report of +0.3% m/m was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.1%, and May was revised higher to unchanged from -0.2%.\u00a0The June US manufacturing production report of +0.1% m/m was slightly stronger than expectations of unchanged.\n\nThe July New York Fed services business activity index rose to -9.3 from -13.2 in June.\n\nThe Fed's Beige Book survey of the US regional economies showed that US economic activity \"increased slightly between late May and early July.\" The report said, \"That represented an improvement over the previous report, in which half of the districts reported at least slight declines in activity.\" The report added, \"Uncertainty remained elevated, contributing to the ongoing caution by businesses.\"\n\nRegarding inflation, the Beige Book stated that all districts reported price increases, with businesses experiencing \"modest to pronounced input cost pressures related to tariffs.\" The report added, \"Many firms passed on at least a portion of the cost increases to consumers through price hikes or surcharges, although some held off raising prices because of customers' growing price sensitivity, resulting in compressed profit margins.\"\n\nExpectations for Fed policy ended the day little changed after some movement on the Powell news.\u00a0Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nBitcoin (^BTSUSD) rallied +2.3% on Wednesday, overcoming part of Tuesday's -3.3% decline.\u00a0 Bitcoin rose after President Trump said he talked right-wing House Republicans into supporting the stablecoin bill the House is considering, although House Speaker Johnson still couldn't get a procedural vote approved by late afternoon.\u00a0 Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.\n\nOn the trade front, President Trump said Wednesday that he intends to send a tariff letter to more than 150 countries, giving the entire group the same tariff.\u00a0 He said that group wouldn't be the \"big\" countries.\n\nRecent trade and tariff news has been mixed.\u00a0 There was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12,\" the deadline for US-China trade talks.\u00a0 There was also some positive trade news on Tuesday after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000. \u00a0Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0The consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are lower.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -1.05%.\u00a0 China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.03%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.04%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) rose +10.5 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield fell -3.2 bp to 4.449%.\u00a0 Bullish factors included the favorable PPI report and some safe-haven demand amidst the latest tariff threats.\u00a0 Bearish factors included the stronger-than-expected US industrial production and Beige Book reports, and the +1.0 bp rise in the 10-year inflation expectations rate to 2.424%.\n\nThe short end of the Treasury curve saw some temporary support from reports that President Trump wants to fire Fed Chair Powell, which could result in a near-term cut in the Fed's federal funds rate target range by Powell\u2019s replacement.\u00a0 However, the long end of the Treasury curve would view a Powell firing as a bearish development due to the inflation risks of a politically driven central bank potentially pursuing artificially low interest rates.\n\nEuropean government bond yields ended mixed.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield fell -2.4 bp to 2.687%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +1.4 bp to 4.639%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks closed mixed, with four gainers and three losers.\u00a0 The largest movers were Tesla (TSLA), with a gain of more than +3.5%, and Amazon (AMZN), with a loss of -1.4%.\n\nWall Street firms reported generally positive results early Wednesday.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs (GS) ended the day up +0.9% after reporting a Wall Street record of $4.3 billion of equity-trading revenue.\u00a0 Also, management fees in asset and wealth management rose +11% y/y.\n\nBank of America (BAC) closed the day down -0.3% despite reporting that its trading division posted a record quarter and that net interest income was better than expected.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) ended the day down -1.3% despite reporting strong equity-trading income and boosting net new assets in its wealth management division.\n\nASML (ASML) fell more than -8% after issuing cautious guidance for next year.\u00a0 The report dampened enthusiasm for the chip sector, which generally turned lower after Tuesday's rally on optimism about the Trump administration's move to loosen some chip sale restrictions to China.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) closed down more than -3%, while\u00a0Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Applied Materials (AMAT) closed down more than -2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks traded higher after bitcoin (^BTCUSD) rallied +2.3% on the improved prospects for House passage of a crypto bill supported by the industry and the White House.\u00a0 Riot Platforms (RIOT), Mara Holdings (MARA), and\u00a0Strategy\u00a0(MSTR) closed up more than +3%.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) rallied more than +6% after raising its full-year sales guidance for the year and reporting better-than-expected Q2 earnings and revenue.\n\nEarnings Reports (7/17/2025)\n\nPepsiCo Inc (PEP), Travelers Cos Inc/The (TRV), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Elevance Health Inc (ELV), Cintas Corp (CTAS), Marsh & McLennan Cos

        "content": "[Federal Reserve System Fed of USA chairman press conference concept. Tribune with symbol and flag of FRS and United States.]\nBet_Noire\n\nEmbattled Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term is up in May 2026.\n\nWe asked Seeking Alpha analysts MTS Insights [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mts-insights], Jack Bowman [https://seekingalpha.com/author/jack-bowman] and Mott Capital Management's Michael Kramer [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management] who they thought might be appointed as the next Fed chair.\n\nMTS Insights [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mts-insights]: After the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting, when it first became clear that there was a division in the Committee members' positioning (about half hawkish, about half dovish), two FOMC members gave dovish remarks that hinted at a July interest rate cut, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. It was suggested that they could be two candidates to replace Powell since they seem willing to cave to Trump's request for lower rates.\n\nHowever, as the discontent with Powell drags on, Trump will probably want to secure his desire for lower rates with an individual who has already proven their loyalty. This makes me think NEC Director Kevin Hassett or even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be the more likely options with an edge to the former since it would be less of a shakeup in Trump's government (Polymarket odds favor Hassett at about 23%).\n\nJack Bowman [https://seekingalpha.com/author/jack-bowman]: Honestly, it's a toss up. Even betting markets like Kalshi and Polymarket are undecided, with no candidate over 50% odds, but frontrunners are currently former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett (in the lead, barely), and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. President Trump has also floated himself as a possibility, but I think that was mostly a joke.\n\nWhile I'm not betting on it, Waller is my pick, as he is currently the most dovish participant in the FOMC. He's also the most likely among those choices to have enough pull with the current FOMC to get them to lower rates faster than currently planned. That kind of social/political capital within the FOMC is very valuable.\n\nMichael Kramer [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management]: Kevin Warsh\u2019s name has been thrown around for years, and he was a candidate that Trump considered the first time around. In my view, the most likely candidate at this point is Chris Waller. He is already on the board; he was appointed under Trump in his first term, and Waller has been saying all the right things when it comes to what Trump wants. It would probably make the transition easier in the interim, and it seems like a logical choice.\n\nMORE ON SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST, VANGUARD S&P 500 ETF, ETC.\n\n \t* Why The Recent Rally Has Me Worried [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801658-why-the-recent-rally-has-me-worried]\n \t* S&P 500: The Rally Tops At 6300 [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801635-s-and-p500-the-rally-tops-at-6300]\n \t* The $20 Trillion Bet: What If Trump Gets His 300bps Cut?

        "content": "[FED federal reserve of USA sybol and sign.]\nBet_Noire\n\nPresident Trump has been very public with his disdain for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump has criticized Powell repeatedly for being hesitant to lower interest rates. In recent days, the Trump administration has claimed Powell could be fired for cause over alleged mismanagement of a $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve's headquarters. \n\nBut can Trump actually remove Powell as Fed chair?\n\nWe asked Seeking Alpha analysts MTS Insights [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mts-insights], Mott Capital Management's Michael Kramer [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management] and Jack Bowman [https://seekingalpha.com/author/jack-bowman] for their views.\n\nMTS Insights [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mts-insights]: Under normal circumstances, the President of the United States should not, and really cannot, remove the Fed chair before his term is up. The Supreme Court has already ruled that Powell can't be removed unless there is a good reason to. It would not be impossible for President Trump to find a viable reason, but it is highly unlikely. I think the threats against Powell are more of a bluff to try and get the Fed chair to resign as the Trump administration is running out of political capital to try and win a legal battle to get Powell out early.\n\nMichael Kramer [https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management]: I'm not a constitutional lawyer, but from what I understand, he can if there is cause, and it seems to me like Trump\u2019s team is working very hard to find cause. If I were to guess, Trump will end up firing Powell, and then it will likely result in a court case. By the time it is resolved, Powell\u2019s term will be either over or nearing its end. With the stock markets at an all-time high, the timing couldn\u2019t be much better.\n\nJack Bowman [https://seekingalpha.com/author/jack-bowman]: As of right now, no, which was made clear by the Supreme Court in May. This means that we will likely see Powell remain as chair until May 2026, when his term is up. The court decision was interesting because it essentially said the president has the power to fire most federal employees, but specified that the Fed was off limits. This means that President Trump will have to wait it out another year with Powell, but after that, he will be able to appoint whoever he chooses, provided the U.S. Senate confirms them.\n\nMORE ON SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST, VANGUARD S&P 500 ETF, ETC.\n\n \t* Why The Recent Rally Has Me Worried [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801658-why-the-recent-rally-has-me-worried]\n \t* S&P 500: The Rally Tops At 6300 [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801635-s-and-p500-the-rally-tops-at-6300]\n \t* The $20 Trillion Bet: What If Trump Gets His 300bps Cut?

        "content": "Mah\u00e9, Seychelles, July 16th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nAster, the next-generation decentralized perpetual exchange (perp DEX) backed by YZi Labs, is once again pushing the frontier of DeFi innovation with the launch of a new asset type on Aster Pro: stock perpetual contracts.\n\nTraders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading U.S. stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures - giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy, or speed.\n\n24/7 Trading of Stock Perps with up to 50x Leverage\n\nUnlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours, and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7, without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage - no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping.\n\nWhile liquidity may be lower outside of traditional U.S. stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street\u2019s active hours, Aster\u2019s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution.\n\nWith NASDAQ\u2019s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well.\n\n\u201cAster is about breaking down barriers whether that\u2019s asset types, market hours, or outdated trading infrastructures,\u201d said Leonard, CEO of Aster. \u201cWith decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we\u2019re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest U.S. equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.\u201d\n\nDeep Liquidity And Secure Pricing via Pyth Network\n\nSimilar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster\u2019s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster\u2019s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets - all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading.\n\nBuilt for Traders, by Traders\n\nThis launch marks a major milestone in Aster\u2019s mission to bridge traditional finance and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling Hidden Orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered L1 with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts.\n\nAs the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities.\n\nUsers can start trading U.S. equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers.\n\nAbout Aster\n\nAster is a next-generation decentralized perpetual exchange built for everyone. It offers MEV-free, one-click trading for crypto with up to 1001x leverage in Simple Mode (BNB Chain, Arbitrum), and advanced tools including Hidden Orders, grid trading, and stock contracts in Pro Mode (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum). Aster Chain is a high-performance blockchain engineered to deliver private and non-custodial onchain orderbook trading. Backed by YZi Labs, Aster is building the future of DeFi: fast, flexible, and community-first.\n\nUsers can learn more at the Aster official website, or connect with Aster on the official X account.\n\nContact\n\nKathy\r\nAster\r\nkathy@astherus.com\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "[Multiple exposure image of London buildings]\nTim Robberts\n\nHSBC Securities analysts shared their regional ideas and preferences for the second quarter.\n\nAmong the groups they are overweight are Europe \u2013 excluding the UK (OTC:IHPXF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHPXF]) \u2013 emerging markets (EEM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EEM]), including China (FXI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXI]). Analysts are underweight Japan (EWJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWJ]) and cautious on Japanese autos, and neutral on the U.S. (SP500 [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500]), (SPY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY]).\n\nHere is a breakdown:\n\nThe Magnificent 7 tech giants (MAGS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS]) continue to demonstrate strong earnings momentum, beating consensus estimates by 17 percentage points in Q1, said Alastair Pinder, head of Emerging Markets and Global Equity strategist at HSBC Securities.\n\n\u201cWith earnings revisions still positive, FX tailwinds, and the consensus expecting a sizable stepdown in earnings growth to 14% year-over-year in Q2 from 30% YOY last quarter, the setup appears favorable,\u201d he noted. This robust performance stands out as one of the most compelling investment narratives in the current market environment.\n\nIn addition, U.S. market conditions present a complex picture, with HSBC analysts expressing caution about longer-term prospects despite attractive near-term opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf U.S. corporates are essentially forced to near-shore supply chains and live with higher input costs, margins and the return on equity could deteriorate,\u201d Pinder warned.\n\nConsumer-related (XLY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLY]), (XLP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLP]) stocks face particular challenges, with the strategist highlighting that \u201cpressure on lower-income consumers is steadily mounting, particularly as elevated mortgage rates start to bite.\u201d\n\nEuropean markets (VGK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGK]), (IEV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEV]), (IEUR [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEUR]), (STOXX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX]), (FEZ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FEZ]) particularly outside the UK, show promising growth potential driven by fiscal stimulus initiatives and possible deregulation, Pinder said.\n\nThe German government\u2019s \u201cspecial fund plans\u201d to inject up to EUR500B (about 12% of GDP) into infrastructure over the next decade, should catalyze earnings revisions from 2026 onwards, he said.\n\nDefense stocks (EUAD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUAD]) remain especially attractive within this region, with Pinder noting that NATO\u2019s formalization of a \u201c5% of GDP defense target by 2035\u201d could support continued sector outperformance.\n\nAlso, emerging markets (EEM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EEM]) present a bullish case with six of nine signals on the strategist\u2019s scorecard \u201cflashing green\u201d compared to just two a year ago.\n\n\u201cFlows, the U.S. dollar (DXY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY]), valuations, policy support, and structural themes are aligning across emerging markets,\u201d he observed. This positive outlook extends particularly to mainland China (MCHI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCHI]), (FXI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXI]), (GXC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GXC]), where policy supports through fiscal measures, monetary policy, and direct market intervention are creating important tailwinds.\n\nChina\u2019s tech sector (CQQQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CQQQ]), (TCHI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCHI]) emerges as a particular bright spot, with the strategist highlighting DeepSeek as \u201ca key catalyst\u201d positioning \u201cChinese internet names (KWEB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KWEB]) as attractive and cheaper AI alternatives for global investors.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, China\u2019s internet stocks (KWEB [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KWEB]) trade at a 12m forward PE of 15.2x, significantly cheaper than the Magnificent 7\u2019s (MAGS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS]) 29.6x,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan (EWJ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWJ]) receives an underweight rating, with the strategist cautioning that it \u201cis one of the most exposed markets to higher tariffs and a slowdown in global trade,\u201d with Japanese automakers (TM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM]), (OTCPK:MSBHF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSBHF]), (HMC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMC]), (OTCPK:NSANY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSANY]), (OTCPK:SZKMY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SZKMY]) showing \u201calmost no pricing power when it comes to tariffs.\u201d\n\nMORE ON VANGUARD TOTAL WORLD STOCK INDEX FUND ETF SHARES:\n\n \t* VT: When Momentum Is Riding High, Diversify [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796450-vt-when-momentum-is-riding-high-diversify]\n \t* VT: Global Stocks Stage A Comeback, Looking For More Gains Ahead [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4779523-vt-global-stocks-stage-a-comeback-looking-for-more-gains-ahead]\n \t* Five key reasons why global equities are poised for upside before Q4 risks \u2013 HSBC [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468014-five-key-reasons-why-global-equities-are-poised-for-upside-before-q4-risks-hsbc]\n \t* Top five key portfolio recommendations for the rest of 2025 \u2013 Wells Fargo [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4457352-top-five-key-portfolio-recommendations-for-the-rest-of-2025-wells-fargo]\n \t* Seeking Alpha\u2019s Quant Rating on Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF Shares [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VT/ratings/quant-ratings]\n\n ",

-0.30%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are down -0.03%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -0.26%.\n\nStocks are seeing support today from the favorable PPI report and positive earnings results from several top Wall Street banks.\u00a0 However, the Nasdaq 100 index is being undercut by weakness in chip stocks, which fell after disappointing guidance from ASML.Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks also saw some weakness after CBS today reported that President Trump asked a group of House Republicans on Tuesday whether he should fire Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 Several of those lawmakers said Mr. Trump indicated he would go ahead with the firing.\u00a0 However, CBS also quoted sources inside the White House as saying that the White House has not yet built a legal predicate for firing Mr. Powell, which can only be done for cause.\u00a0 In any case, Mr. Trump is continuing to pressure Mr. Powell to voluntarily resign.\n\nToday's June PPI report was favorable, as both the month-over-month and year-over-year figures were better than expected, suggesting that tariff inflation has not yet hit the producer level.\u00a0 The PPI report sparked some inflation optimism after Tuesday's mixed CPI report.\n\nSpecifically, the June final-demand PPI was unchanged m/m and +2.3% y/y, which was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y.\u00a0 The June core PPI report of unchanged m/m and +2.6% y/y was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.6% y/y. \u00a0The year-over-year figures of +2.3% (nominal) and +2.6% y/y (core) were down from the revised May figures of +2.7% and +3.2%, respectively.\n\nToday's June US industrial production report of +0.3% m/m was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.1%, and May was revised higher to unchanged from -0.2%.\u00a0 The June US manufacturing production report of +0.1% m/m was slightly stronger than expectations of unchanged.\n\nThe July New York Fed services business activity index rose to -9.3 from -13.2 in June.\n\nThe Fed's July Beige Book report will be released later today.\n\nExpectations for Fed policy were little changed after today's economic reports, but the reports about a possible Powell firing slightly boosted the chances for a rate cut.\u00a0Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 5% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting (versus 3% Tuesday) and 64% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17 (versus 58% Tuesday).\n\nBitcoin (^BTSUSD) is up +2.3% today, overcoming part of Tuesday's -3.3% decline, after President Trump cajoled right-wing House Republicans later yesterday to vote in favor of the crypto legislation supported by the White House and the crypto industry.\u00a0 President Trump said he expects the House to pass the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill today.\u00a0 Those Republicans yesterday blocked the legislation by voting against a procedural motion.\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.\u00a0 The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing today entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which is expected to promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nRecent trade and tariff news has been mixed.\u00a0 There was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12,\" the deadline for US-China trade talks.\u00a0 There was also some positive trade news on Tuesday after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000. \u00a0Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, Fifth Third, and GE.\u00a0 Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are lower.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.62%.\u00a0 China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.03%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.04%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) are up +9 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp at 4.465%.\u00a0 Bullish factors today include the favorable PPI report and today's -0.4 bp decline in the 10-year inflation expectations rate to 2.410%.\u00a0 Bearish factors include today's slightly stronger-than-expected US industrial production report.\n\nThe short-end of the Treasury curve saw support from the slightly increased chances for a Fed rate cut on today's heightened news that President Trump may soon fire Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 However, the long-end of the Treasury curve would view that as a bearish development due to the inflation risks of a politically-motivated central bank.\n\nEuropean government bond yields are mixed.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.693%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +3.1 bp at 4.656%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed today, with three gainers and four losers.\u00a0 The largest movers are Tesla (TSLA), with a gain of more than +2%, and Amazon (AMZN), with a loss of more than -1%.\n\nWall Street firms today reported positive results that boosted the stocks in pre-market trading, although those stocks are now trading lower.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) was up more than +1% in pre-market trading but then faded and is now trading -0.6% lower.\u00a0Goldman reported a Wall Street record of $4.3 billion of equity-trading revenue.\u00a0 Also, management fees in asset and wealth management rose +11% y/y.\n\nBank of America (BAC) is down more than -2% despite reporting that its trading division posted a record quarter and that net interest income was better than expected.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) is down more than -3% despite reporting strong equity-trading income and boosting net new assets in its wealth management division.\n\nASML (ASML) is down more than -10% after issuing cautious guidance for next year.\u00a0 The report dampened enthusiasm for the chip sector, which turned lower today after yesterday's rally on optimism about the Trump administration's move to loosen some chip sale restrictions to China.\u00a0 \u00a0Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Applied Materials (AMAT) are down more than -4%.\u00a0 Micron Technology (MU), Lam Research (LRCX), and\u00a0KLA Corp (KLAC) are down more than -3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are trading higher today after President Trump yesterday apparently convinced right-wing House members to vote in favor of the stablecoin legislation currently before the House.\u00a0 Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) today is up +2.3% after Tuesday's -3.3% decline.\u00a0 Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are up more than +5%, and Coinbase (COIN)\u00a0is up more than +3%.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) is up more than +5% after raising its full-year sales guidance for the year and reporting better-than-expected Q2 earnings and revenue.\n\nEarnings Reports (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial Services Group I (PNC), Bank of America Corp (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc/The (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL), Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI).\n\nOn the date of publication,

        "content": "Culver City, United States, July 16th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nSnail, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNAL) (\u201cSnail Games\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a leading global independent developer and publisher of interactive digital entertainment, announced its intention to explore pursuing a strategic digital asset initiative that includes the evaluation and feasibility for introduction of its own proprietary stablecoin. This initiative would be subject to a range of factors, including but not limited to, regulatory approvals, market conditions, technical feasibility, cybersecurity safeguards, financial controls, and internal governance. The Company believes that exploring stablecoin infrastructure may position it as an early mover within the digital entertainment industry. While no decisions have been made to integrate such technology into the Company\u2019s corporate strategy, it continues to evaluate and explore opportunities as part of its broader innovation roadmap.\n\nRecognizing the growing potential of crypto-based transactions in the digital entertainment and gaming industry, the Company is currently assessing the feasibility of developing and exploring its stablecoin with multiple external use cases, with no current timeline or commitment.\n\nTo support this initiative, Snail Games has retained Dr. George Cao, an external consultant. Dr. Cao earned his PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Chicago and is the Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of AscendEX, a full-stack cryptocurrency financial platform that offers simple solutions for investing, trading, and earning to global users. In addition, the Company also retained seasoned legal advisors, including a nationally recognized law firm ranked by\u00a0Chambers FinTech Legal USA\u00a0as a leading firm serving cryptocurrency and blockchain clients.\n\n\u201cThis stablecoin exploration is a natural evolution of our innovation-led strategy and will support a broader effort to evaluate how blockchain-based technologies could be aligned with the Company\u2019s long-term goal to be at the forefront of digital transformation in the entertainment space,\u201d said Snail, Inc. co-CEO Hai Shi. \u201cTo support this initiative, we\u2019ve engaged a nationally recognized law firm and a seasoned strategic advisor to support and guide the successful exploration of this opportunity. We are evaluating potential future phase hiring needs for professionals with specialized experience in blockchain, stablecoins, and digital asset strategy. While our focus continues to remain on gaming across our ARK franchise, indie titles, and other up-and-coming genres, this investigation into the crypto space and evaluation of the feasibility of launching our own stablecoin would mark a key step in advancing our vision of driving innovation across digital entertainment. We\u2019re excited to share continued updates as we reach meaningful milestones in our evaluation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAbout Snail, Inc.\n\nSnail, Inc.

        "title": "Stocks Pressured by Chip-Stock Sell-off and Increased Talk about Powell Firing",
        "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) today is down -0.07%,\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview])\u00a0(DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) is up +0.05%, and the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) is down -0.30%.\u00a0 September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) are down -0.03%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) are down -0.26%.\n\nStocks are seeing support today from the favorable PPI report and positive earnings results from several top Wall Street banks.\u00a0 However, the Nasdaq 100 index is being undercut by weakness in chip stocks, which fell after disappointing guidance from ASML.\n\nStocks also saw some weakness after CBS today reported that President Trump asked a group of House Republicans on Tuesday whether he should fire Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 Several of those lawmakers said Mr. Trump indicated he would go ahead with the firing.\u00a0 However, CBS also quoted sources inside the White House as saying that the White House has not yet built a legal predicate for firing Mr. Powell, which can only be done for cause.\u00a0 In any case, Mr. Trump is continuing to pressure Mr. Powell to voluntarily resign.\n\nToday's June PPI report was favorable, as both the month-over-month and year-over-year figures were better than expected, suggesting that tariff inflation has not yet hit the producer level.\u00a0 The PPI report sparked some inflation optimism after Tuesday's mixed CPI report.\n\nSpecifically, the June final-demand PPI was unchanged m/m and +2.3% y/y, which was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y.\u00a0 The June core PPI report of unchanged m/m and +2.6% y/y was weaker than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.6% y/y. \u00a0The year-over-year figures of +2.3% (nominal) and +2.6% y/y (core) were down from the revised May figures of +2.7% and +3.2%, respectively.\n\nToday's June US industrial production report of +0.3% m/m was slightly stronger than market expectations of +0.1%, and May was revised higher to unchanged from -0.2%.\u00a0 The June US manufacturing production report of +0.1% m/m was slightly stronger than expectations of unchanged.\n\nThe July New York Fed services business activity index rose to -9.3 from -13.2 in June.\n\nThe Fed's July Beige Book report will be released later today.\n\nExpectations for Fed policy were little changed after today's economic reports, but the reports about a possible Powell firing slightly boosted the chances for a rate cut.\u00a0Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 5% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting (versus 3% Tuesday) and 64% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17 (versus 58% Tuesday).\n\nBitcoin (^BTSUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) is up +2.3% today, overcoming part of Tuesday's -3.3% decline, after President Trump cajoled right-wing House Republicans later yesterday to vote in favor of the crypto legislation supported by the White House and the crypto industry.\u00a0 President Trump said he expects the House to pass the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill today.\u00a0 Those Republicans yesterday blocked the legislation by voting against a procedural motion.\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.\u00a0 The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing today entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which is expected to promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nRecent trade and tariff news has been mixed.\u00a0 There was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12,\" the deadline for US-China trade talks.\u00a0 There was also some positive trade news on Tuesday after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia.\n\nHowever, stocks were undercut by negative trade news that emerged last week and during this past weekend.\u00a0 Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.\u00a0Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nThe markets will focus on any fresh news regarding tariffs or trade deals during the remainder of this week.\u00a0 On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000. \u00a0Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.\u00a0 On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million. \u00a0Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results. \u00a0Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, Fifth Third, and GE.\u00a0 Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u00a0Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\u00a0\n\nOverseas stock markets today are lower.\u00a0 The\u00a0Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.62%.\u00a0 China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.03%. \u00a0Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.04%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) are up +9 ticks.\u00a0 The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp at 4.465%.\u00a0 Bullish factors today include the favorable PPI report and today's -0.4 bp decline in the 10-year inflation expectations rate to 2.410%.\u00a0 Bearish factors include today's slightly stronger-than-expected US industrial production report.\n\nThe short-end of the Treasury curve saw support from the slightly increased chances for a Fed rate cut on today's heightened news that President Trump may soon fire Fed Chair Powell.\u00a0 However, the long-end of the Treasury curve would view that as a bearish development due to the inflation risks of a politically-motivated central bank.\n\nEuropean government bond yields are mixed.\u00a0 The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.693%.\u00a0 The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +3.1 bp at 4.656%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed today, with three gainers and four losers.\u00a0 The largest movers are Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]), with a gain of more than +2%, and Amazon (AMZN [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/overview]), with a loss of more than -1%.\n\nWall Street firms today reported positive results that boosted the stocks in pre-market trading, although those stocks are now trading lower.\u00a0\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GS/overview]) was up more than +1% in pre-market trading but then faded and is now trading -0.6% lower.\u00a0Goldman reported a Wall Street record of $4.3 billion of equity-trading revenue.\u00a0 Also, management fees in asset and wealth management rose +11% y/y.\n\nBank of America (BAC [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BAC/overview]) is down more than -2% despite reporting that its trading division posted a record quarter and that net interest income was better than expected.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MS/overview]) is down more than -3% despite reporting strong equity-trading income and boosting net new assets in its wealth management division.\n\nASML (ASML [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ASML/overview]) is down more than -10% after issuing cautious guidance for next year.\u00a0 The report dampened enthusiasm for the chip sector, which turned lower today after yesterday's rally on optimism about the Trump administration's move to loosen some chip sale restrictions to China.\u00a0 \u00a0Marvell Technology (MRVL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRVL/overview]) and Applied Materials (AMAT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMAT/overview]) are down more than -4%.\u00a0 Micron Technology (MU [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MU/overview]), Lam Research (LRCX [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/LRCX/overview]), and\u00a0KLA Corp (KLAC [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/KLAC/overview]) are down more than -3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are trading higher today after President Trump yesterday apparently convinced right-wing House members to vote in favor of the stablecoin legislation currently before the House.\u00a0 Bitcoin (^BTCUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) today is up +2.3% after Tuesday's -3.3% decline.\u00a0 Mara Holdings (MARA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MARA/overview]) and Riot Platforms (RIOT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RIOT/overview]) are up more than +5%, and Coinbase (COIN [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/COIN/overview])\u00a0is up more than +3%.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/JNJ/overview]) is up more than +5% after raising its full-year sales guidance for the year and reporting better-than-expected Q2 earnings and revenue.\n\nEARNINGS REPORTS (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial Services Group I (PNC), Bank of America Corp (BAC), Johnson & Johnson
