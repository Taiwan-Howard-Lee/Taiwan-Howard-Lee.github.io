        "title": "If You Buy Apple With $10,000 in 2025, Will You Become a Millionaire in 10 Years?",
        "content": "Key Points\n\nApple's ability to introduce inventive products and easy-to-use software has created a loyal following among consumers across the globe. This business has returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders since the start of fiscal 2012. The stock will be higher a decade from now, but monster gains are a thing of the past. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't having a great year. As of July 16, shares are down 16% in 2025. This negative trend hasn't prevented the stock from soaring 562% in the previous 10-year period. Worries about tariffs and slow progress with artificial intelligence (AI) might be the key factors on the minds of investors these days.\n\nBut let's say that you're not deterred. If you buy Apple shares today with $10,000, will that starting sum turn into $1 million by 2035?Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBecoming a dominant tech enterprise\n\nApple's success over the years has largely come down to the company's expertise in brand management, its innovative culture that consistently introduces popular products, and its design expertise that prioritizes the user experience. It's not just about the iPod, iPhone, MacBook, iPad, AirPods, or Watch, for example, but about how these devices seamlessly integrate with the software and services to create Apple's powerful ecosystem.\n\nThis is one of the best businesses in the world with unmatched reach. During the first-quarter 2025 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that there are more than 2.35 billion active Apple devices across the globe. That figure continues to creep higher over time. And it demonstrates just how ubiquitous Apple has become.\n\nEqually if not more impressive is that these products provide Apple with the opportunity to generate more recurring revenue. ''We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform,\" CFO Kevan Parekh said on the Q2 2025 earnings call. With an offering set that ranges from financial services like Pay and Card, all the way to TV+, Music, and Fitness+, among others, Apple is proving that's it not just a hardware company.\n\nFor a business to build this kind of adoption, especially in the notoriously difficult arena of consumer technology, it requires the rare ability to truly resonate with consumers over a long period of time. Apple's brand is extremely strong, which drives customer loyalty and pricing power.\n\nApple's services segment posted 11.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 (ended March 29), faster than the business overall. And this segment reports a stellar 75.7% gross margin, driving impressive profitability for the company. Apple raked in $24.8 billion in net income during the most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe management team hasn't shied away from returning capital to shareholders. Since the start of fiscal 2012, Apple has returned a whopping $987 billion to its investors. The vast majority has come from stock buybacks, with about $15 billion paid in dividends annually.\n\nApple over the next decade\n\nA good rule of thumb in investing is that winners will continue winning. Apple is clearly a fantastic business that has many wonderful qualities. And it has done nothing but take care of its shareholders in the past.\n\nBut investors must view the situation today and over the next decade with clarity.

        "content": "Key Points\n\nApple's ability to introduce inventive products and easy-to-use software has created a loyal following among consumers across the globe.  This business has returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders since the start of fiscal 2012.  The stock will be higher a decade from now, but monster gains are a thing of the past. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't having a great year. As of July 16, shares are down 16% in 2025. This negative trend hasn't prevented the stock from soaring 562% in the previous 10-year period. Worries about tariffs and slow progress with artificial intelligence (AI) might be the key factors on the minds of investors these days.\n\nBut let's say that you're not deterred. If you buy Apple shares today with $10,000, will that starting sum turn into $1 million by 2035?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBecoming a dominant tech enterprise\n\nApple's success over the years has largely come down to the company's expertise in brand management, its innovative culture that consistently introduces popular products, and its design expertise that prioritizes the user experience. It's not just about the iPod, iPhone, MacBook, iPad, AirPods, or Watch, for example, but about how these devices seamlessly integrate with the software and services to create Apple's powerful ecosystem.\n\nThis is one of the best businesses in the world with unmatched reach. During the first-quarter 2025earnings call CEO Tim Cook mentioned that there are more than 2.35 billion active Apple devices across the globe. That figure continues to creep higher over time. And it demonstrates just how ubiquitous Apple has become.\n\nEqually if not more impressive is that these products provide Apple with the opportunity to generate more recurring revenue. ''We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform,\" CFO Kevan Parekh said on the Q2 2025earnings call With an offering set that ranges from financial services like Pay and Card, all the way to TV+, Music, and Fitness+, among others, Apple is proving that's it not just a hardware company.\n\nFor a business to build this kind of adoption, especially in the notoriously difficult arena of consumer technology, it requires the rare ability to truly resonate with consumers over a long period of time. Apple's brand is extremely strong, which drives customer loyalty and pricing power.\n\nApple's services segment posted 11.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 (ended March 29), faster than the business overall. And this segment reports a stellar 75.7% gross margin, driving impressive profitability for the company. Apple raked in $24.8 billion in net income during the most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nThe management team hasn't shied away from returning capital to shareholders. Since the start of fiscal 2012, Apple has returned a whopping $987 billion to its investors. The vast majority has come from stock buybacks, with about $15 billion paid in dividends annually.\n\nApple over the next decade\n\nA good rule of thumb in investing is that winners will continue winning. Apple is clearly a fantastic business that has many wonderful qualities. And it has done nothing but take care of its shareholders in the past.\n\nBut investors must view the situation today and over the next decade with clarity. With sustainable earnings per share (EPS) growth, Apple's stock price will be higher in 2035, I believe. That might be the only positive perspective that I have.\n\nI don't think shares will outperform the broader S&P 500. After all, EPS is projected to increase at a yearly clip of 8.7% between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027, according to Wall Street consensus estimates.

        "content": "Matt Deitke, co-founder of Seattle-based AI startup Vercept, has joined Meta's (NASDAQ:META) Superintelligence Lab after receiving a direct offer from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Deitke described the initiative as \"the most exciting bet I've seen in tech history,\" signaling Meta's bold ambitions in artificial general intelligence, GeekWire reports.\n\nDeitke brings advanced expertise in embodied AI and 3D computer vision, having previously worked at the Allen Institute for AI and studied at the University of Washington before founding Vercept in 2024, according to GeekWire.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.30/share Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs \u2014 And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nMeta Offers Up to $300M Over Four Years to Build the Most Elite AI Team in the World\n\nMeta is offering compensation packages worth as much as $300 million over four years to attract elite AI talent for its Superintelligence Lab. According to GeekWire, the first-year payout can exceed $100 million, a figure larger than many startups raise in early rounds.\n\nZuckerberg has stated on Threads that Meta will invest \"hundreds of billions of dollars into compute\" to support its superintelligence vision. With compensation packages that can dwarf entire seed rounds, companies like Meta can effectively cherry-pick top talent from promising startups, GeekWire reports.\n\nDeitke confirmed that Zuckerberg personally reached out and initiated the hiring conversation, which quickly led to an offer. \"Zuck reached out and we chatted and I talked to a few people on the team, and shortly after received an offer,\" he told GeekWire.\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

He has also updated his LinkedIn to reflect his new role as \"AI Researcher @ Meta Superintelligence Lab.\"\n\nVercept Moves Forward Without Co-Founder but With $16M from Elite Backers\n\nVercept has raised $16 million in seed funding from major names including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, DeepMind Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, GeekWire says. The company is building Vy, an AI-powered Mac app that understands screens and performs tasks through natural language.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVy is Vercept's flagship native Mac application designed to radically simplify how humans interact with computers. Instead of navigating menus or searching for help articles, Vercept says that users can give natural language commands as Vy understands what's on their screen and takes action intelligently, directly within the software they already use.\n\nEarly benchmarks on the company website show Vy significantly outperforming competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic on UI understanding and screen navigation tasks.\n\nSee Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation \u2014 You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25\n\nVercept CEO Kiana Ehsani confirmed Deitke's departure in a post on X, referencing the \"comp rumors\" surrounding Meta's offers to top engineers. She noted his early role in shaping Vercept's roadmap and said the team remains \"fired up\" about the company's future. Ehsani also joked about joining Deitke \"on his private island next year,\" a reference to the rumored compensation scale for Meta's new AI team.\n\nDespite leaving, Deitke expressed full confidence in Vercept's continued success, calling the team \"absolutely amazing\" and telling GeekWire that the direction they are building remains \"very exciting.\"\n\nMeta has already brought on top researchers, including OpenAI's Lucas Beyer, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Ruoming Pang, former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross of Safe Superintelligence, Geekwire says.\n\nWith plenty of capital and the ability to attract top-tier researchers, Meta's Superintelligence Lab continues to grow as one of the most closely watched AI initiatives in the industry.\n\nRead Next: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": " [Wall street district in New York City with USA flags in the background] \nFilippoBacci\n\nU.S. STOCKS ENDED THE WEEK MOSTLY HIGHER, with the S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq (+1.5%) setting new record highs, lifted by strong Q2 earnings and softer-than-expected inflation data. June retail sales also beat forecasts, helping offset worries over tariffs and Federal Reserve independence. The Dow Jones dipped slightly, ending the week down 0.1%.\n\nAMID A POSITIVE WEEK FOR THE MARKET, THESE WERE SOME OF THE TRENDING STOCKS:\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGTI]) surged during Wednesday trading after achieving a new milestone, which places its quantum computing systems closer to achieving profitability. The Berkeley-based quantum computing company said it reached a key mid-year milestone, achieving 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity on its modular 36-qubit system.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics (SRPT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRPT]) shares plunged after a third patient death was reported linked to the company\u2019s gene therapies, intensifying scrutiny over the safety of its treatments, Bloomberg reported. The latest death occurred last month during an early-stage trial for a therapy targeting limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\nLucid (LCID [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCID]) shares advanced after it announced a partnership with Uber (UBER [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER]) to develop a \u201cnext generation premium global robotaxi program\u201d using Nuro autonomous vehicle technology. As part of the deal, Uber (UBER [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER]) will invest $300M in Lucid (LCID [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCID]) and a \u201cmulti-hundred-million dollar\u201d investment in Nuro.\n\nNetflix (NFLX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX]) was in focus as the streaming giant beating expectations with its second-quarter results, while lifting its full-year outlook. The stock remains a strong performer, up nearly 50% since hitting a low in April.\n\nASML (ASML [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML]) slumped 7% despite reporting strong Q2 results, including a 23% Y/Y revenue increase. The chip-equipment maker guided Q3 sales between \u20ac7.4B and \u20ac7.9B with a gross margin of 50%\u201352%, and reaffirmed its 2025 outlook for 15% revenue growth and ~52% margin. However, CEO Christophe Fouquet cautioned that growing macro and geopolitical uncertainty makes the 2026 growth outlook too early to confirm.\n\nNvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]) shares rose after the AI giant said it expects to resume H20 GPU sales to Chinese customers, citing U.S. assurances on export licenses. Rival AMD (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]) also announced a similar move later, jumping over 7% after confirming it will resume shipments of its MI308 chips to China with U.S. government approval.\n\nElevance Health (ELV [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELV]) fell after the managed care insurer cut its full-year earnings outlook alongside its second quarter results. The company now expects adjusted net income of $30 per diluted share, down from a prior range of $34.15\u2013$34.85. The revision was driven by higher-than-expected costs in its Medicaid and ACA exchange businesses. The warning also weighed on shares of industry peers.\n\nMP Materials (MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) rallied after securing a $500M commitment from Apple (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]). Under the agreement, MP Materials, the operator of the only U.S. rare earths mine, will supply Apple (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) with magnets produced at its Fort Worth, Texas, facility using recycled rare earth feedstock processed at its Mountain Pass site in California.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]) drew attention after the chipmaker posted Q2 results, topping earnings expectations with a 60% jump in profit but missing on revenue. Despite the revenue miss, year-over-year growth came in strong at 38.6%. For Q3, TSMC guided revenue between $31.8B and $33B, with the midpoint ($32.4B) beating the $31.84B consensus.\n\nInvesco (IVZ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVZ]) stock jumped in Friday midday trading after the investment firm filed a proxy statement seeking to convert its QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ]) to an open-end fund from a unit investment trust.\n\nMORE ON THIS WEEK'S TRENDING STOCKS\n\n \t* Nvidia: Back In China?

        "title": "Trump's antitrust cops are OK with new mergers. Old tech monopolies, not so much.",
        "content": "President Trump's antitrust cops are friendlier thus far about mergers than their predecessors, but they are refusing to let up on one prominent priority of the Biden administration: monopoly prosecutions of the nation's best-known tech giants.\n\nSix months into Trump\u2019s second term in office, his antitrust regulators have already given the green light to more than 100 merger transactions, feeding the optimism of Wall Street bankers that new dealmaking will have widespread support in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn June, antitrust enforcers gave a go-ahead to three deals worth a combined $63 billion, including candy giant Mars\u2019 $36 billion takeover of Kellanova (K), and the DOJ announced a settlement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) allowing it to acquire software developer Juniper.\n\nThis month, the DOJ announced that it closed a major investigation into telecom giant T-Mobile's (TMUS) $4 billion acquisition of USCellular assets that allowed the tie up to proceed.A T-Mobile store in San Diego, Calif. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Carter via Getty Images\n\nAdministration officials claim the approvals are not a free pass because many have required pre-merger divestments or licensing requirements.\n\nYet at the same time, Trump's DOJ and FTC have shown no plans to relent in a series of high-stakes government prosecutions targeting the competitive tactics of Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL).\n\nNor have they shown any signs of unwinding investigations into Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).\n\nThat's despite efforts by the CEOs of these companies to curry favor with Trump, with many showing up in person for the president's inauguration in January. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried unsuccessfully this spring to stop a government trial against his company from going forward.\n\n\u201cThe criticism coming into this administration is that all of these Big Tech CEOs that were at the inauguration were going to get sweetheart deals; that they were going to settle these cases for pennies on the dollar,\" said Slade Bond, former principal deputy assistant attorney general in the Biden administration's Office of Legislative Affairs.Guests including Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Elon Musk attended the Inauguration of Donald J. Trump in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 20. (Julia Demaree Nikhinson - Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\n\"And that just hasn't happened.\"\n\nThe Trump approach to new mergers, however, is \"different,\" Bond said, explaining that Trump\u2019s regulators have made it clear that they're more open to structuring deals in a way that Biden's DOJ antitrust head Jonathan Kanter and former FTC chair Lina Khan were not.\n\nArnold & Porter said the latest approvals clearly demonstrate the administration\u2019s willingness to negotiate.\n\nThe approach with mergers is \"a noteworthy shift away from the prior administration,\" according to a recent note published by the Washington D.C.-based law firm.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd the shift demonstrates the administration\u2019s willingness to negotiate, it added. \"FTC and DOJ Antitrust leadership resisted pre-litigation merger settlements during the Biden administration, choosing to litigate to challenge deals instead of accepting remedies.\"\n\nBut \"the new Trump administration leadership appears willing to accept divestitures to resolve its competitive concerns, providing an opportunity for merging parties to avoid litigation to get deals done.\"\n\n'The world knows we\u2019re going to be very serious'\n\nThe more flexible approach to mergers is not stopping Trump's enforcers from pressing ahead with dozens of prosecutions and investigations into the ways that dominant Big Tech companies are hanging onto their market power.\n\nThe DOJ, along with a group of US states, is waiting for judges to rule on their requests to force Google to break up its empire, after prevailing in two landmark cases against Google in 2024 and April this year.\n\nIn each case \u2014 one filed during Trump\u2019s first term in office and one brought by the Biden administration \u2014 the DOJ and states have pushed for remedies that would remake Google\u2019s search engine and online advertising empires.\n\nIn another ongoing case that Trump's FTC took to trial against Meta in April, regulators are awaiting a California federal judge's decision on their claims that the social media titan leveraged its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to box out competitors.\n\nAmazon and Apple are also in the new administration's antitrust crosshairs.Apple CEO Tim Cook seen behind US President Donald Trump and US Vice President JD Vance after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. (Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nIn two federal lawsuits brought by the Biden administration and inherited by Trump's FTC, regulators allege that Amazon illegally maintained its monopoly in the markets for online superstores and online marketplace services, and deceived customers into renewing Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nBiden\u2019s DOJ accused Apple of violating antitrust laws in an ongoing federal case in New Jersey, now under the direction of Trump's DOJ. The complaint alleges that the iPhone maker abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nOne top Trump antitrust official, Roger Alford, said in May that Trump's regulators were focused on prosecuting anticompetitive behavior that impacts everyday Americans.\n\nIn addition to the cases against Big Tech, he applauded Biden-era antitrust lawsuits filed against private equity firm Thoma Bravo's real estate management software developer RealPage and event promoter and ticket distributor Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster (LIV).\n\nAlford said to expect the administration's regulators to focus on protecting competition in markets where average Americans spend their money, like housing, transportation, insurance, and entertainment.\n\n\"So bring cases in those kinds of categories,\" he said. \"I think the world knows we\u2019re going to be very serious about antitrust enforcement.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Key Points\n\nArm's market capitalization has already reached $160 billion, indicating significant growth in the stock. Its net income arguably does not justify its current valuation. 10 stocks we like better than Arm Holdings \u203a\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) has long stood out in the semiconductor industry, particularly regarding its mobile phone processors. Instead of manufacturing these processors, it earns revenue by licensing its designs to companies such as Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm.\n\nDespite its importance to major industry players, it did not launch its initial public offering (IPO) until September 2023, and its value has nearly tripled since the original IPO price. Amid those gains, investors may wonder whether the stock will mint millionaires, or do its past gains make such a scenario unlikely?Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe state of Arm stock and growth prospects\n\nWhile investors may assume that Qualcomm and Samsung, among others, thrive on in-house chip designs, the truth is that these companies could not design their mobile chipsets without Arm's help, highlighting the essential role it plays in the mobile phone industry.\n\nUnfortunately, despite playing this critical role in the industry, it may not make investors as wealthy as some may hope. The company came into existence in 1990, meaning it remained private for 33 years and built its current client base operating that way.\n\nConsequently, it had grown to a substantial size by the time it launched its IPO. When the stock came to the market, it debuted with a market cap exceeding $65 billion, and it has more than doubled to over $160 billion as of the time of this writing.\n\nTo put that into context, if you invested $10,000 today, and Arm somehow grew to the point that it matched Nvidia's market cap of $4 trillion (an unlikely prospect), your investment would increase 25-fold.\n\nThat would take the position's value to about $250,000, far short of \"millionaire\" status. For that investment to reach $1 million, the market cap would have to grow to about $16 trillion.\n\nTo add further context, Amazon had a market cap of less than $1 billion early in its history, leaving a massive runway for growth given today's $2.4 trillion market cap. Unfortunately, due to the timing of Arm's IPO and the size of the company, it significantly reduced the potential for an explosive growth runway for shareholders.\n\nThe financial case for Arm Holdings stock\n\nMoreover, one has to wonder whether Arm can justify the current lofty market cap given its financials. In fiscal 2025 (ended March 31), Arm reported a net income of $792 million from just over $4 billion in revenue. That amounted to 159% profit growth.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nAlso, analysts forecast net income growth of just 9% in the next fiscal year before reaccelerating to a 34% profit increase in fiscal 2027.\n\nStill, that leaves the stock with a 200 P/E ratio, and even when measured by the forward P/E ratio, the forward earnings multiple of 85 likely means investors have to pay a considerable premium for this stock.\n\nWill Arm Holdings stock help you become a millionaire?\n\nArm Holdings is undoubtedly an essential company whose stock offers the potential for considerable returns. However, the stock is unlikely to turn small investors into millionaires.\n\nThe most significant challenge to Arm minting millionaires is its size. At nearly $160 billion, it has already amassed considerable growth. Hence, to turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million, it would have to grow to a market cap that is quadruple the current record market cap for a public company.\n\nAdditionally, its current profit levels suggest that the stock's price has outpaced its fundamentals, making its short- and medium-term prospects for a rising stock price uncertain.\n\nConsidering the company's role in designing mobile processors, Arm is in a strong position to deliver shareholder gains in the long run. But unless you can invest considerably more than $10,000 in Arm stock, you should not expect that investment to reach a $1 million size.\n\nShould you buy stock in\u00a0Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

Perplexity is a large language model (LLM) akin to ChatGPT.\n\nGiven the rise of ChatGPT and the popularity of LLMs over traditional search in general, I think integrating Perplexity as a native component of Apple's operating system makes a lot of strategic sense. There are multiple ways that Apple could strengthen its services through a product such as Perplexity.\n\nFor example, adding Perplexity as a new layer of Siri could help Apple create more sophisticated voice assistant functionality across its installed base. In addition, Apple could use Perplexity in Safari to power AI-generated answers to search queries -- ultimately opening the door to more directly rivaling Microsoft Copilot or Alphabet's Google search.\n\nBeyond Perplexity, I see two moonshot opportunities that Apple could consider exploring. First, Safe Superintelligence could be somewhat of a logical fit, as one of its co-founders actually used to lead AI projects at Apple. Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity, Safe Superintelligence is still very much in research and development (R&D) mode.

Much of Apple's technology is either easily portable (iPhone, MacBook Pro) or wearable (AirPods, iWatch). To me, Figure AI opens up a lot of doors for Apple, but ultimately may be a distraction from the company's consumer electronics empire.\n\nOverall, I agree with Ives that Apple should make an acquisition to supercharge its position in the AI race.\n\nShould you buy stock in\u00a0Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

To me, Figure AI opens up a lot of doors for Apple, but ultimately may be a distraction from the company's consumer electronics empire.\n\nOverall, I agree with Ives that Apple should make an acquisition to supercharge its position in the AI race.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "I'm sure most avid basketball fans can remember when \"AI\" was used to describe NBA great Allen Iverson. Nowadays, when you hear AI, the first thing many people think about is artificial intelligence (AI). It makes sense, too, when you consider just how prominent AI-related news has been over the past couple of years.\n\nAI has been around for a while, but recent developments and the success of generative AI applications like ChatGPT have brought it to the forefront of many businesses. Because of this, there's been a surge in many stocks dealing with AI in virtually any capacity.\n\nAI is transforming industries, and investors looking to get in on the action should consider the following two stocks. Investing $1,500 in each will give investors great growth potential, as well as dividend income -- a true two for the price of one.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nFrom the outside looking in, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) may not seem like an AI stock, but its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any company right now.\n\nIf you read the last part of the last sentence and thought, \"Even more important than Nvidia?\" -- the answer may surprise you. Nvidia has been the stock market's biggest story for the past year or so, largely because of the importance of its graphic processing units (GPUs) to data centers used to train AI.\n\nNvidia's GPUs, however, heavily rely on the semiconductors that TSMC manufactures. As the world's leading semiconductor foundry, TSMC arguably produces the best semiconductors globally, attracting many top tech clients. Without the company's semiconductors, it's safe to assume that the quality of Nvidia's GPUs (and many other electronics) would suffer, causing a quality drop chain reaction.\n\nThe demand for TSMC's semiconductors should grow for the foreseeable future and continue the positive momentum the company's financials picked up since suffering from a slowdown in smartphone sales. Its second-quarter (Q2) revenue increased nearly 33% year over year and 10% from Q1.\n\nTSM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nFor a while, smartphone-related semiconductor sales were the bulk of TSMC's revenue, but in this past quarter, high-power computing (which includes AI-related chips) accounted for 52% of its revenue -- up from 24% in Q1.\n\nTSMC may encounter some geopolitical issues -- such as export restrictions -- but the company's long-term positioning remains strong. Its dividend yield of about 1.2% is also on par with the S&P 500's, incentivizing investors to remain patient as it potentially works through those roadblocks.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is an interesting AI play because of its partnership with ChatGPT's creator, OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions in OpenAI to help speed up its AI research and development, and the relationship has since become mutually beneficial. OpenAI uses the company's cloud platform Azure for its supercomputing power and infrastructure to train and run its AI models. In return, Microsft gets to deploy OpenAI's models in its suite of consumer and enterprise products.\n\nMicrosoft's portfolio of products -- including its Office software like Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Teams -- is already one of the most used in the world, and this OpenAI integration has strengthened user experience and capabilities. You'd also have to think it's partly responsible for Office 365's 15% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nIn Q3 of its fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue grew 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, led by its \"Intelligent Cloud\" segment, which includes Azure's business.\n\nMSFT Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft's intelligent cloud segment generated $26.7 billion in revenue, up 21% year over year, and Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure lags behind Amazon Web Service (AWS) in market share -- 25% to AWS' 31% -- but has been making positive strides that should continue with new AI integrations.\n\nAs part of the partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft released Azure OpenAI, which gives customers Azure's computing and security capabilities while running all of OpenAI's models. In the competitive cloud computing industry, offering an essential one-stop shop is an advantage, and this partnership puts Microsoft on track to do that and gain ground on AWS.\n\nMicrosoft's dividend yield is less than 1%, so it's far from ideal for income-seeking investors. However, the payout is an added benefit to a stock with a price that has risen by more than 50% in the past 12 months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft PT hike; Tesla, Intel could soar on earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nBank of America hikes Microsoft PT ahead of earnings\n\nBank of America (BofA) this week raised its price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $585 from $515 ahead of the company\u2019s July 30 earnings release, flagging strong momentum in cloud infrastructure, encouraging partner feedback, and early signs of traction from its AI Copilot tools.\n\nBofA said partner checks indicate deal activity in the fourth quarter was \u201clargely in line\u201d with Q3, supporting a \u201c0-1% upside\u201d to its $73.7 billion revenue estimate. Azure is expected to grow 35.5% year-over-year in constant currency, with \u201c18.0% points from AI,\u201d driven by cloud migrations and demand in security and data analytics.\n\nThe bank sees Microsoft\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes segment growing 13% in constant currency, slightly above its base case. \u201cPartner feedback suggests stable E3/E5 upgrade activity and ramping Copilot adoption,\u201d it noted.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, BofA models 3.4% growth, aided by stronger PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead, the firm expects 14% revenue growth in fiscal 2026, matching fiscal 2025. While its 45.5% margin forecast could face pressure from higher capital spending, BofA analysts said capex should remain \u201clargely consistent as a % of revenue at 31%.\u201d\n\nCalling Microsoft its \u201ctop pick,\u201d the analysts said the next catalyst could be \u201cmore evidence that Copilot is becoming more material to growth.\u201d Despite a 30% rally since Q3, they see more upside as Azure and AI continue to gain ground.\n\nGolden era of AI is just starting, analyst says\n\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping the tech sector, and its impact is still in the early stages, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives.\n\nIn a note Friday, Ives predicted a strong second half of 2025 for tech stocks, supported by a \u201cvery strong 2Q tech earnings season\u201d and growing AI tailwinds across chips, software, and enterprise applications.\n\n\u201cWe have barely scratched the surface of this 4th Industrial Revolution,\u201d he wrote, calling it a \u201cgolden age\u201d for technology.\n\nThe analysts estimate $2 trillion in AI-related spending from enterprises and governments over the next three years. \u201cThe Street is underestimating the underlying AI-driven growth ahead,\u201d they said, noting that \u201cuse cases are exploding\u201d as companies scale up adoption.\n\nGenerative AI is moving into a consumption phase, which Wedbush sees as a major catalyst for software. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) were listed as the firm\u2019s top tech picks for the remainder of the year.\n\nDespite ongoing geopolitical risks and tariffs, the analysts expect a favorable policy environment. \u201cThe Trump Administration will continue to soften its stance around tariffs,\u201d they wrote, pointing to Nvidia\u2019s return to selling H20 chips in China as a \u201ckey strategic positive.\u201d\n\nWedbush also highlighted AI\u2019s broad ripple effect across the sector. \u201cFor every $1 spent with Nvidia, we estimate the multiplier is another $8 to $10 spent throughout the rest of the tech ecosystem,\u201d the note said.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs more AI to sell more hardware: HSBC\n\nApple\u2019s push to boost iPhone upgrades through AI has yet to gain traction, according to HSBC analysts, who argue the company needs a more compelling AI offering to revive demand.\n\n\u201cThe iPhone still represents about half of Apple\u2019s sales,\u201d the bank wrote, but \u201cinitial hopes that AI would accelerate the renewal cycle have been short-lived.\u201d\n\nHSBC said Apple Intelligence, announced in June 2024 and rolling out through April 2025, has \u201cso far failed to trigger significant improvement in user experience.\u201d\n\nThe delayed launch of AI-powered Siri may also cause users to hold off on upgrading, the analysts warned. In the meantime, Apple will have to rely on standard hardware improvements.\n\n\u201cBetter specs with iPhone 17 in September should entertain the demand, in-line with what has been seen with the iPhone 16,\u201d HSBC noted, assuming tariffs don\u2019t push prices significantly higher.\n\nTrade concerns remain a key overhang. The investment bank said Apple \u201ccannot re-localise production fast enough to avoid U.S. tariff hikes,\u201d and pointed out that market forecasts now assume a 20% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nApple has already guided to a $900 million margin impact for the June quarter, though HSBC still expects the company to generate more than $100 billion in annual free cash flow.\n\nBeyond trade, regulatory pressures are also building. The European Commission is probing Apple for potential Digital Markets Act violations, while a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit introduces \u201clong-term risk to the business model,\u201d the bank said.\n\nHSBC kept a Hold rating and a $220 price target, citing a \u201c5% regulatory discount\u201d and cautioning that legal and tariff risks may limit near-term upside.\n\nTesla shares may outperform after Q2 results, Barclays says\n\nTesla shares may outperform following second-quarter results despite deteriorating fundamentals, according to Barclays. In a recent note, the bank called the setup \u201cconfusing\u201d but acknowledged upside potential, driven by investor focus on the company\u2019s long-term autonomous vehicle strategy.\n\n\u201cWe see potential for the stock to outperform,\u201d analysts wrote, pointing to expectations that the earnings call could spotlight Tesla\u2019s robotaxi ambitions. \u201cThe earnings call also presents an opportunity for Tesla\u2019s robotaxi/AV narrative to shine,\u201d they said, adding that Elon Musk may discuss fleet growth or expansion plans.\n\nBarclays expects a modest sequential improvement in auto gross margin excluding regulatory credits, though it warned margins will \u201clikely remain depressed vs prior years.\u201d\n\nThe bank also anticipates a 10% decline in 2025 vehicle deliveries, noting that consensus earnings forecasts have been sharply cut. \u201cWhereas \u201925 consensus EPS was over $3.20 into the beginning of the year, it is now down to $1.84,\u201d the note said.\n\nThe expected delay of Tesla\u2019s low-cost model could further pressure sentiment. Barclays believes Tesla may prioritize a third-quarter pre-buy ahead of the September 30 expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, potentially pushing the launch of the cheaper vehicle into the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cTesla likely to focus on a 3Q pre-buy...which could be perceived negatively,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nStill, Barclays argues that optimism around autonomous vehicles could outweigh weaker near-term fundamentals.\n\nIntel stock could squeeze higher during earnings\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares may be set for a short-term rally into earnings season, according to Citi, which sees potential for an upside surprise that could trigger a squeeze. Despite being one of the most shorted names in the sector, the bank believes improving fundamentals could shift sentiment.\n\n\u201cIntel remains the most popular short but we believe the stock could squeeze higher during earnings given potential upside to EPS,\u201d analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a Friday note.\n\nCiti pointed to lower capital expenditure and operating expenses, along with possible strength in the PC market\u2014which accounts for 60% of Intel\u2019s revenue\u2014as key factors. The bank\u2019s second-quarter estimates are above consensus.\n\nMore broadly, Citi held a mixed outlook on semiconductor stocks heading into Q2 results, suggesting a differentiated earnings season across the group.",

        "content": "Key Points\n\nThere are multiple catalysts that could send Carnival stock higher. Alibaba is one of the most undervalued big tech giants in the world.10 stocks we like better than Carnival Corp. \u203a\n\nThe S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) hit new highs in July, but there are plenty of solid companies in growing industries that could be bargain buys right now.\n\nLet's look at two stocks that are reporting solid earnings results while their valuations appear too good to pass up.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Carnival\n\nCarnival(NYSE: CCL) has enjoyed a strong recovery over the past few years. The stock is up 258% since the end of 2022, following eight consecutive quarters of record revenue. There are still catalysts ahead that can support more gains for investors buying shares at the current $30 share price.\n\nDespite challenges in certain sectors of the economy, there appears to be no slowing in demand for cruises. Carnival raised its full-year guidance for net yields to 5%, which is a key measure of profitability for a cruise company. Bookings are pacing in line with last year's record levels and at historically high prices, benefiting yields and earnings. As a result, analysts are expecting full-year adjusted earnings per share to land at $2, up 40% over last year.\n\nOne of the negatives for Carnival is its high debt burden. It ended the last quarter saddled with $27 billion of total debt. However, its debt-to-equity ratio peaked at 5.75 in 2023 and has come down to 2.72. Higher profits are helping the business reduce debt, which lowers Carnival's risk profile and can lead to higher earnings from lower interest expense.\n\nCarnival also has some things in the works to drive more demand, such as the launch of its exclusive destination in Grand Bahama, Celebration Key. Looking ahead to 2026, Carnival will launch an expansion of its RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas.\n\nCarnival is not just a post-pandemic recovery play. It is clearly positioning itself to deliver long-term growth for shareholders. On that note, Carnival is tapping into the growth of the experience economy, as more people opt to spend their money on experiences rather than material goods.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2029, analysts expect Carnival's earnings to reach $3.10, or grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 17% from fiscal 2024. With the stock trading around 10 times those estimates, there is still significant upside potential from current share prices.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA) is one of China's top tech companies, with leading market positions in e-commerce and cloud computing. The stock has started to recover after falling well off its previous highs, but it still looks undervalued.\n\nDespite Alibaba posting a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter, and even stronger earnings growth of 23%, the stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 12. The low valuation reflects geopolitical risks and increasing competition from rival e-commerce platforms.\n\nHowever, the conservative valuation seems too low for a few reasons. While direct sales on Alibaba's domestic e-commerce marketplaces were down 1% year over year last quarter, the segment's total revenue grew 9%, as Alibaba raised fees it charges to sellers on its marketplaces. This fee-based model provides Alibaba leeway to keep revenue growing during tough times.\n\nIt's also continuing to show great international expansion potential, with AliExpress growing revenue by 22% year over year last quarter. Moreover, management expects the international e-commerce business to achieve profitability in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe real strength for Alibaba right now, and why its stock could soar, is growth at Alibaba Cloud. The cloud business posted a strong 18% year-over-year revenue increase last quarter, and it could accelerate further, as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) remains strong. AI-related services have grown revenue at triple-digit rates for seven straight quarters, and it's seeing demand across multiple industries like internet, retail, and manufacturing.\n\nIn April, Alibaba launched its new Qwen3 AI model, which offers deeper reasoning capabilities and faster responses. Alibaba stock traded higher earlier this year with the announcement that it is partnering with Apple to bring its AI to the iPhone in China.\n\nThe stock has fallen 23% since reaching a 52-week high in February, but another better-than-expected quarter, especially with respect to Alibaba Cloud and AI, could send the stock to new highs in the second half of 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) -Nvidia-backed Perplexity AI, the startup challenging Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its AI-powered search engine, is in discussions with mobile device makers to pre-install its new Comet browser on smartphones, CEO Aravind Srinivas told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe move could significantly boost Perplexity\u2019s reach by capitalizing on browser \"stickiness\", where users tend to stick with browser apps that are pre-installed or set as default on their devices, potentially driving habitual use of the company\u2019s AI tools.\n\n\"It\u2019s not easy to convince mobile OEMs to change the default browser to Comet from Chrome,\" Srinivas said, referring to original equipment manufacturers and\u00a0highlighting the challenge of user inertia on mobile platforms.\n\nComet, currently in beta and available only on desktops, integrates Perplexity\u2019s AI directly into web browsing, allowing users to ask questions about personal data like emails, calendars, or browsing history, and even perform tasks such as scheduling meetings or summarizing webpages.\n\nPerplexity aims to target \"tens to hundreds of millions\" of users next year after stabilizing the desktop version for a few hundred thousand initial testers, Srinivas said.\n\nIts efforts reflect a broader industry shift\u00a0toward browsers with agentic AI capabilities, ones that need minimal human intervention to make decisions and achieve specific tasks.\n\nReuters reported earlier this month that OpenAI is developing its own agentic AI browser, which could automate complex tasks such as booking travel or managing finances.\n\nAs of last month, Google\u2019s Chrome had a market share of about 70% in mobile devices, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s Safari and Samsung\u2019s browsers together commanding another 24%, according to Statcounter data.\n\nBloomberg News reported in June that Perplexity was in talks with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Apple to integrate its AI search capabilities into their devices, potentially enhancing assistants like Bixby or Siri.\n\nPerplexity has completed a $500 million investment round, which valued it at $14 billion earlier this year. Its investors include Accel, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Jeff Bezos and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. </p>",

        "title": "Should You Sell Apple's Stock Before July 31?",
        "content": "Key Points\n\nApple's stock trades at a premium to the market despite slow growth. Apple has fallen behind in the AI arms race. Tariff impacts could harm the company's margins. 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nAs earnings season approaches, investors should review their portfolios and assess whether there is still upside left or if the next piece of news could be negative. This could apply to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), as investors have been fairly bearish on the stock for a good reason.\n\nWhile the rest of the market has rallied from its lows in April and May, Apple's stock has remained relatively flat, down 15% for the year at the time of this writing. I think this lack of participation isn't a buying opportunity; it's a sign of things to come. As a result, it may be a good idea to unload shares before Apple's next quarterly earnings report on July 31.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple has failed to be an innovator lately\n\nApple needs little introduction; it's the leading consumer technology brand and millions around the globe own its products. However, there's only a limited population, and Apple may have neared the saturation point for its product line.\n\nFurthermore, Apple has failed to release any real game-changing features in recent years. It wasn't all that long ago when consumers would purchase a new iPhone each year for all of the new upgrades. Now, it's only incremental battery life and camera upgrades, with little true innovation.\n\nOn the AI front, Apple has been left behind by its Android peers, as Apple Intelligence, its take on AI, hasn't delivered anything noteworthy.\n\nThis is a telltale sign of a company that's relying on its prior success, and it's evident in Apple's financials.\n\nApple's growth has been very slow recently\n\nApple's revenue growth has been poor over the past few years.AAPL Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nWith Apple's 5.1% increase last quarter looking like a huge improvement from prior quarters, that's not a great position to be in. However, for a mature company like Apple, investors care more about earnings per share (EPS) growth than revenue growth. Apple can repurchase shares and improve margins to squeeze out faster earnings growth than revenue growth, but those days may be limited as well.AAPL EPS Basic (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nApple has repeatedly delivered quarters with less than a 10% EPS growth rate, which suggests it may underperform the market over the long term, given the market's long-term average growth rate of around 10%. Despite Apple continuously delivering slower-than-average growth, its stock trades at a hefty premium to the market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nAlthough Apple's valuation has come down, its 29.4 times forward earnings is still far more expensive than the S&P 500's 23.7 times forward earnings.\n\nThis suggests that the market is overpaying for Apple's stock, and its third-quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings announcement on July 31 could serve as another wake-up call for investors. There wasn't much that happened in the quarter that could have boosted Apple's sales, and with tariffs likely squeezing its margins, the odds of the stock moving lower are far more likely than it moving higher.\n\nInvestors should consider moving on from Apple stock. It has been on a great run and produced phenomenal returns, but there are many other stocks with stronger growth that look like better places to be invested in right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Friday, July 18, 2025\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa Inc. (V). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAhead of Wall Street\r\n\r\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company is witnessing weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, which is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Apple is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. \r\n\r\nApple expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia is helping Apple sell more of its devices, including iPhone. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past year (+41.6% vs. +40.7%). The company\u2019s second-quarter 2025 results reflected solid capital markets performance and decent loan growth. The company's business expansion initiatives, moderate loan demand and relatively high interest rates will drive net interest income (NII) growth. \r\n\r\nYet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. As the company invests in technology and marketing, operating expenses are expected to remain elevated. Weak asset quality due to a challenging macroeconomic environment is another concern. \r\n\r\nWhile a solid resurgence in deal-making activities is likely to take time, a solid pipeline and the company\u2019s leadership position will drive the investment banking (IB) business. Its enhanced capital distributions seem sustainable.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nVisa\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+32.3% vs. +26.2%). The company\u2019s strong market position is underpinned by consistent volume-driven growth, acquisitions and technological leadership in digital payments. Expansion in cross-border volumes, rising digital transactions, and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects. \r\n\r\nA robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth. In 2Q FY25, processed transactions grew 9% year over year. However, Visa faces rising client incentives and expenses, which may weigh slightly on margins. \r\n\r\nThe company expects high single- to low double-digit expense growth in fiscal 2025. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structures. The stock\u2019s premium valuation suggests limited near-term upside. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

However, increased labor costs weigh on the bottom line.\n\nPrecision Tech to Aid CNH Industrial (CNH) Amid High Debt\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, a strong position in the Precision Technology space is likely to support CNH's margins and market share gains. However, the rising debt level remains a concern.\n\nHealthEquity (HQY) Gains on HSA Growth Amid Macro Challenges\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, HealthEquity's HSA-driven momentum and strong solvency position support its growth, though regulatory hurdles, competition and data security concerns remain key risks.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) Focus on Pre-Teen Customers to Fuel Comps \r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Five Below's impressive merchandise, focus on pre-teen customers & pricing strategy should drive comparable sales.

I'm your host, Joe Pompeano, and I'm here to coach you through the financial game. Today we've got Yahoo Sports senior writer Frank Schwab joining the show to discuss the NFL as training camps begin, and Learfield president and CEO Cole Gahagan joining us to discuss the evolving business of college sports. Let's huddle up and get right into it.We are kicking off this week with POP's Playbook. Why I take a look at some of the biggest headlines in sports that you and your portfolio need to know. First up, multiple reports indicate that Apple is the heavy favorite to landform of the one's US broadcasting rights. Pop reported last week that Apple offered F1 $150 million per year for its US media rights. That figure is nearly double the $85 million ESPN currently pays to Formula One. And according to the Athletic, ESPN offered $95 million to retain the F1 rights. However,Puck reports that ESPN will not match Apple's offer. Now, if Apple does secure Formulle One's media rights, it would be the 3rd major sports package for the tech giant, along with Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball. But this Apple deal could carry some risks for Formula One if it chooses a larger meteor rights payout versus the broader distribution and reach of ESPN. However, Formula 1 may think the risk is worth it after Apple's successful run for the F1 movie starring Brad Pitt. The film has made nearly $400 million at the box office since its release.Next up, the sports betting company FanDuel was valued at $31 billion in a recent minority stake sale. Last week, FanDuel's parent company, Flutter Entertainment, acquired the remaining 5% stake of the sportsbook that it didn't own from Boyd Gaming in a $1.76 billion deal. Now, while Flutter has a 100% control of FanDuel after this deal, Fox also has an option to purchase an 18.6% stake in.By December 3, 2030, Fox acquired the option to purchase shares after FanDuel took over Canadian gaming company, The Stars Group in 2020. Fox originally had the option to purchase equity in the Starz Group, but that option was converted to purchase shares in FanDuel after its 2020 takeover of TSG. Fox executive chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch said last year that Fox plans to exercise the option.And luckily for Fox, the option stipulates that the company can buy the 18.6% stake for $4.5 billion based on FanDuel's 2020 market value of $24.2 billion. To round out Pomp's playbook, I'm looking ahead to the Open Championship, which takes place at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland this weekend. The Open is the last golf major of the year, and world number one Scottish Scheffler is the favorite to win according to multiple sports books. Scheffler and the rest of the open field will be competing for a $3.1 million championship prize and the iconic.Claret Jug. In total, the O's prize pool will be $17 million the same as it was last year, making the tournament the lowest paying major of the professional golf calendar. Behind the PGA Championship at $19 million the Masters at $21 million and the US Open at $21.5 million. And while most of you listening and watching will likely never play in the Open, that doesn't mean you can't play Royal Porteros. The 137-year old golf club is open to the public, and you can play around at the same course as this year's Open Championship for roughly $540.All right, let's talk some football. NFL training camps are ramping up this week. So today we're bringing on Yahoo Sports senior writer Frank Schwab to talk about the upcoming NFL season. Frank, thank you so much for joining us today, and I'd love to just start with some general training camp storylines that you're watching this season, whether it's players, coaches, organizations, teams, etc. What are you keeping an eye on of interest?\n\n3:32 spk_1\n\nWell, there's a lot. I, I mean, it's it's one of those things where the when training camps start, all 32 teams have something exciting, interesting. I, I think you got to start at the top, the Philadelphia Eagles, just coming off this massive great Super Bowl win. Can they repeat? It's very tough. We saw the the Kansas City Chiefs do it before them, but what the Chiefs did is rare. It is, it is tough to repeat in the NFL. So keeping, definitely keeping an eye on the Eagles to start with. CSAquan Barkley can repeat his great season. And then there's the teams.Just fell short. Uh, how did the Chiefs rebound? The Super Bowl hangover is real. It hits a lot of teams, especially the losing ones. How did they come back? Can they get back on track with their dynasty? And then teams like the Ravens with Lamar Jackson, can they ever make a Super Bowl, get past Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs? Can the Bills, Josh Allen, the MVP, can they get past the, the Chiefs and make a Super Bowl? It's like Patrick Mahomes is, is sucking up all of the oxygen in the room and making all the Super Bowls like Michael Jordan did for the Chicago Bulls and.1990s. So do other teams get a chance? And then you have some great rookies out there, you know, Travis Hunter with the Jacksonville Jaguars trying to play both ways, which we really have never seen in the NFL on a full-time basis. Can he do that? Just things like that, really, really interesting. And the beauty of trying to get, the beauty of the preseason is hope, hope springs eternal, I guess, and every team thinks it has a chance or at least has something that they're going into the season looking forward to. There's just, there's just so much optimism around the entire league at this time of year.\n\n4:59 spk_0\n\nYou, of course, didn't mention my team because we didn't fall just short, but I'm a Giants fan. So selfishly, I'm interested in hearing about how, how do you think they're going to navigate, uh, basically moving on from Russell Wilson at some point into Jackson Dar, obviously their first round pick.\n\n5:13 spk_1\n\nAbsolutely, there there aren't many quarterback competitions around the NFL in training camp, but the Giants certainly seem to be one of them. Now, is it really a competition? They've said, hey, Russell Wilson's gonna be our starter to begin the year, but Jackson Dark can change that, and I think about an example, ironically, Seattle, about 12 or so years ago, where a rookie named Russell Wilson came in, beat out Matt Flynn in the preseason, and the Seahawks just said, hey, go do what you can, kid, let's see what you got. Turned out pretty well for Russell Wilson.I can see something similar happening with Jackson Dart, their first round pick, uh, because Russell Wilson at this point in his career, he's kind of the ceiling is pretty low. Uh, we've seen the best out of Russell Wilson, I think, in his career. So do at some point the Giants see enough from Jackson Dart in August to say, hey, let's just start the youth movement now. Let's give him week one. Let's see what he can do. I don't think that's going to happen. I think Russell Wilson starts.The season, but definitely some interest in the Giants with their, they got a fantastic defense. Abdul Carter, 3rd pick of the draft, added to their defensive line. They're a very interesting team, especially with a coach and Brian Day on the hot seat, general manager Joe Shane on the hot seat coming into the season. How they navigate when they kind of unveil Jackson Dart in the regular season is a massive storyline for the Giants going forward.\n\n6:28 spk_0\n\nYeah, Frank, I'd love to hear just from like a 30,000 ft view perspective of just like the business of the NFL, right? If we think about the NFL today, I mean, it's experienced monster growth over the last decade. It's by far and away the most popular sports league in America, most profitable sports league in the world. There's international growth. Roger Goodell seems to want to stick around for another, uh another contract as league commissioner. What is your opinion on just like how big the NFL is today, but where they can go from here and how they can continue to grow the business?\n\n6:54 spk_1\n\nAnd I, you know what, I would say that it's gotta stop somewhere. There has to be some plexiglass principle going on where you reach the top and you can't go any further, right? ButThe NFL just keeps growing and it it has blown me away in the past few years. Well, we have this fractured media world, right, where everybody's watching everything else. There's no monoculture anymore. We're not all sitting down to watch Cheers on a Thursday night, right? But yet everybody seems to sit down to watch the NFL. When you've seen other sports get affected, I think the NBA has been affected with their ratings. You saw that in the most recent finals. Major League Baseball for sure is seeing its ratings kind of dwindle, because just that's how everything.Every, every stream is something on Netflix, and we have no attention span. But yet tens of millions of people in the Super Bowl's case, hundreds of millions of people tune in to watch this game and are talking about it, and it's become such a communal event. I, I think the NFL has just gotten very lucky with our product that it is a product you can invest in one day a week on a Sunday in the fall and have your fantasy teams and in some states you're betting. So when you when you ask me, where can the NFL go.From here, in my mind, I'm like they can't grow any bigger than they have. But then why not? The international market is huge for them. They're having 7 international games this year. That's something they want to do. You know, Roger Goodell's come out and said basically that he can envision a scenario where there's an international game every week. And, and I think that that's really where the NFL wants to grow is internationally. But even domestically, it just continues to grow and grow and get bigger and we've seen some sales of franchises where we'reThe sticker shock is just kind of amazing and how the NFL has grown. I give them a lot of credit because again, everything else has been fractured and our attention spans, and we don't do anything communally anymore, but yet the NFL does. The NFL is one of the rare, rare things that we all share live on a Sunday night or a Monday night, where everybody's kind of do.Doing their own thing. Everybody, yes, everybody might stream that new Netflix show, but it's all different times, we'll talk about it whenever. This is the NFL is still the one thing that we kind of come together with.\n\n8:58 spk_0\n\nYeah, it's a very good point. I remember a while ago Mark Cuban said pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. The NFL was getting hoggy. That was a decade ago and it hasn't slowed down. So we'll see if that happens anytime soon, but thank you so much for joining us today, Frank.Absolutely, I appreciate it. All right, we have to take a quick break, but when we come back, I'll be talking to Learfield president and CEO Colga Hagen.Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Sports Report. I'm your host, Joe Pompeana. We've made it to the one on one, a conversation where I get to break down news and sports with the key player in the industry. This week, we're talking to Learfield president and CEO Cole Gahagan. Cole, thank you so much for joining us today. And I'd love to just start with sort of like a simple overview question of what exactly Learfield does. If you could just explain it for the viewers and listeners who may not be familiar with their business, whether that's, you know, the services that the company provides or even the clientele that you work with.\n\n9:59 spk_2\n\nJoe, it's good to be with you. Happy to answer that question. As you can imagine, it's a question that I answer pretty frequently. I often say that Learfield is the largest, most influential company in college athletics you've never heard of. That's because so much of what we do is in the background of the, of, of the business of college sports. We have 6 operating business units, and for the most part outside of a of a few disciplines, food and beverage.Retail, we, we power almost everything that happens in the business of of college athletics. So we're mostly known for our sports properties business, or multimedia rights where we monetize athletics departments, intellectual property through media partnerships, sponsorships, etc. it's the biggest part of our business, both in terms of revenue and and bottom line contribution. I also often say we sort of sit at the center of everything commercially that's happening in in college athletics.\n\n10:50 spk_0\n\nSo I think you took over as president and CEO in 2020, you correct me if I'm wrong, but that sounds like a, a difficult time to take over that role given COVID and then everything we've seen over the last few years with NIL and now the settlement. How has the business evolved since that time to today?\n\n11:06 spk_2\n\nOhwow. Well, it almost feels like it's been 6 years, uh, almost 5.5, 6 years, but it almost feels like uh 50 to 60 years, to be honest with you. The business has evolved significantly. I would tell you in inThe, the, the three biggest ways the business has evolved is number one, we're a much more congruent operation. Um, I think that when, when I came on board, my remit from the board of directors at the time was relatively simple. It was figure out how to integrate the business units that were inside the enterprise.And then how do we modernize a, a business that for in very large measure had kind of been the same for 30 or 40 years. Again, particularly in that core multimediaites operation. So that's the first way that business has changed. In fact, funny enough, we just wrapped our annual company conference last week, and the theme of this year's conference going into this new fiscal year was one Lear Field, that all of these business units come together to make this a really successful business. The second way that it's.Evolved, honestly, Joe is, um, just a completely different and modern company, particularly again in that multimedia rights space. We are data-centric, we're the largest data platform in all of college athletics, one of the biggest data platforms globally. We have 115 million known fans in our database, which is known as Fanbase. We provide that data and insights back to schools to help them drive more activity at their athletics departments.We're a data-centric operation, we're a media operation. Uh we do over 1 billion.5 million impressions every year of content that we create on behalf of brands, athletes, and, and schools. Uh, we have our own proprietary programmatic marketing platform that we use to reach fans 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on behalf of schools and brands. So there's just a lot that's happened in the last several years, not just to evolve the company, make it more congruent, but to modernize it as well.\n\n12:51 spk_0\n\nYeah, and I'd love to just tap in on the data component you mentioned there, because I think a lot of people look at sort of the marketing or the, uh, the way that some of these athletic departments are run and they think it's sort of just throwing things at the wall, but you mentioned that you guys have 115, I think it was million data points on fan information you send this back to the schools. If you could just give us a little information on what the schools are doing with this, like how are they using that data to drive ticket sales and other things like that?\n\n13:14 spk_2\n\nIt's a great question. Look, in all industries, but especially sports and entertainment as it relates to fans, I think people talk a whole lot about data, but they don't talk enough about um two very important things. What is the source of that data and what and what are you doing with it? And then how are you monetizing it? Those are two very important factors that I don't think businesses talk enough about, particularly in the B2B space. So let's break down each.Most importantly, the data that we get is first party data, which in a world of of increasing stringent um data practices and and and um policies by the metas of the world, the alphabets of the world, having the rights to first party data is really important.Our first part of data comes from two primary sources that I often call the sort of front door of college athletics, if you will, Pay and inside on. If you're a fan of college athletics, the chances are really good. We see you multiple times throughout the year, and I either see you in an anonymized way because you're on the official athletics site or you're on the mobile app, and I may not be able to know that you're Joe and your email is this and and your your credit card info is is this.But I can drop, I can create a profile around you by tracking your activity and ultimately market to you, or I know you in a be anonymized way, which is to say you bought a ticket, we have your contact information.And we can, we can, uh, uh, leverage that data that we acquired during that transaction to go build a similar profile. What we do with it, and most importantly how we monetize it in three primary ways. Number one, as I mentioned, we, we have a data dashboard where we share, uh, insights back with the schools. So again, information around where your fans are coming from, where they live, how many events they're frequenting, all of that information more that helps you really.Understand your fans better and then you can drive donor and development as a result of it. You can sell more merchandise, you can sell more tickets to your events. The 2nd and 3rd areas that we use it are in our multimediaites business. Knowing who the fans are gives us the opportunity and the license to market to those fans 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on behalf of the brands that pay us to have association with the school's IP. And the third.The way that we monetize that data, Joe is through use by our sellers. We have over 800 sellers all over the country, across 150 different college sports properties, and they're growing the sponsorship business on behalf of those schools. The more they know about the fans in Lubbock, in Gainesville, in Ames, Iowa, etc. the more effective they can be when they're talking to sponsors about becoming a partner at those schools.Because we know where those fans are, we understand their demographic and their makeup, and we can market to them in a more holistic way, so our sellers are able to use that data to be more effective as well.\n\n15:58 spk_0\n\nThat's awesome. I'm glad I asked that question because that was super insightful. But the last question I have for you, Cole is around how athletic departments are driving new revenue, right? With the House versus NCAA settlement, it created this new revenue sharing model, and we've seen schools get a little bit creative on how they're going to drive additional revenue to fund athlete compensation, city naming rights deals, new ticket fees, talent fees, whatever you want to call them.The first part of the question is, what have you seen that is working well for schools and something that you think is, is critical in this area? And then #2, what are some untapped areas that you think we might be seeing in the future?Well,\n\n16:32 spk_2\n\nit's interesting on the heels of a conversation about the modernization of of our of our business over the last several years that I'm gonna shift back, I'm shift a little bit from the digital to the analog for a second.The reality is that in college athletics, our traditional sports marketing assets and categories have lagged a little bit behind our colleagues in the pros, because as you know, the, the fundamental difference between these two pockets of of sports.Are that the pros, whether you go back a century plus, when Major League Baseball and the NBA and the NFL were founded, or you even look to some of the the more recent establishments of professional leagues in women's soccer and lacrosse, and even a little bit further back MLS, all of those leagues were founded around a core principle of a business model.Where you have to, your biggest expense is paying your players, so you have to construct a business and an operation around a pretty sizable P&L with pretty extensive costs, especially again to those players. College, of course, is the exact opposite. Not only was it not founded on those same sort of principles of having to pay.Players, because of the fact that it's, it, it's centered around amateur sports, because of the fact that they're still students at these institutions and getting an education in many cases, scholarships. For 80 years, universities didn't necessarily have the same factors driving business performance that you saw in the pros. Well, now we do. In an age of, of rev sharing, we have capped 20.5 million.Uh, going out to athletes and rev share from the institutions, some will reach that cat, some won't, but either way, they now have a, a, a similar factor at play that is driving them to improve their business. So what that means is, so many schools are now leaning in, where perhaps they were hesitant over in years past, to sell naming rights, to sell uh rights on a field.To sell rights on a court or monetized, you know, assets that are fairly common in the pros. Historically, maybe you saw hesitan hesitancy in in college to do that. Those, those hesitancies are coming down fast, and I think more presidents, chancellors, and certainly ADs.are leaning in and trying to figure out what we can monetize more. So again, you know, we've really worked over the last 5 years, Learfield has to drive sort of modernization in college athletics at a time that it needs it most. You know, we haven't had a chance to talk a lot about NIL, but that's been another big factor of growth and opportunity for athletes and for schools.But there's also the sort of analog traditional sports marketing factors that are going to drive growth in the years ahead that we can't overlook. And I think naming rights, field rights, court rights, uh, and assets that we can monetize now that historically we haven't is gonna be important. Now, the second part of your question is,Um, what about the things that we haven't tapped into yet? And again, remember, naming rights, court rights, field rights, those types of things, we're still at our infancy and really monetizing them at scale. But I think beyond that, to your point, we're gonna see more multi-purpose facilities around stadiums and arenas. We're gonna see, uh, I think developments not dissimilar from the battery in Atlanta, because we've seen what kind of revenue growth and profitability growth that has, has helped, uh, the Braves achieve.So I think we're gonna see more multi-use and multi-purpose development, not dissimilar from what is is being built in Knoxville right now, around college campuses, and again, you're gonna see as a result of that, more initiatives, more assets, and more opportunities to significantly increase revenue on, on campuses.\n\n20:09 spk_0\n\nThat's a great one because pro sports haven't even really fully got there yet. So if college sports can start, I think that's a great place to be. College sports are changing so much though, Cole, and you guys are at the forefront of it. So thank you so much for joining us today.The clock is winding down here, but we have just enough time for some final buzz. So let's talk about Michael Jordan's old mansion in the Chicago suburbs. If you ever wanted to live like basketball legend Michael Jordan, you're in luck. The six time NBA champion's former Chicagoland mansion is now available for rent. Jordan built the massive home in 1995 before the Chicago Bulls' second 3P championship run, and it can now be rented out.On Airbnb, the house, which sits on a 7.39 acre lot and features a front gate with Jordan's iconic number 23, is located in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park and has a ridiculous amount of amenities, including seven bedrooms, 17.5 bathrooms, a movie theater, a gym, a cigar lounge, a massive wine cellar, multiple bars and pool tables, and saltwater aquariums.MJ's former palace also features an infinity edge swimming pool, a private fishing pond stocked with bass and bluegill, a professional grade putting green, and obviously a full basketball court. Now Jordan originally listed the home for $29 million in 2012. However, the mansion sat on the market for 12 years before real estate investor John Cooper bought it last year for $9.5 million.And if you want to book Jordan's mansion, which is now called Champions Point Legendary Living on Airbnb, it won't be cheap. Renting the home requires a $25,000 security deposit, and you need to book the mansion for a minimum of 7 nights, which will cost you more than $120,000 for the week.Anyone booking the property must also sign a nondisclosure agreement and liability waiver. Parties and events are not allowed. Only 12 guests can stay in the house at a time, and no pets are allowed either. So while there will never be another Michael Jordan for $120,000 you and 11 friends can live like Mike for a week.We're all out of time, so it's officially game over for this week.

        "title": "Apple Stock\u2019s 4 Biggest Competitors \u2014 Should You Invest?",
        "content": "Apple has been a reliable long-term investment that has regularly outperformed the S&P 500. Shares are pretty steady over the past year and have more than doubled over the past five years. However, while iPhone sales and the App Store have defined Apple\u2019s financials for many years, it has taken a recent dip as sales are growing slowly.\n\nCheck Out: 12 Best Safe Investments To Grow Your Money in 2025\n\nFor You: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle\n\nThe big tech company could also see margin pressure from moving production locations. Even Needham analysts recently downgraded Apple from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold\u201d and withdrew their price target for the stock, which isn\u2019t always the best news for investors. Apple is currently selling at $211.25 a share and has a market cap of $3.13 trillion (as of July 17, 2025).\n\nHowever, Apple\u2019s success and opportunities still make it one of the biggest contenders in tech, which has attracted several competitors. Apple investors may want to keep up with the competition and consider these other four companies for portfolio diversification.\n\nAlphabet\n\nStock price: $183.47 (as of July 17, 2025) Market cap: $2.21 trillion\n\nAlphabet is one of Apple\u2019s top competitors due to its Android phones and Google Play, the company\u2019s answer to the App Store. Android is the leading mobile operating system worldwide, while Apple is in the second spot. However, the App Store brings roughly twice the amount of revenue as the Google Play Store.\n\nApple outearns Alphabet and has a higher profit margin, but investors may want to monitor Alphabet for its artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. Although Alphabet got off to a rough start with AI, the company has adapted. Google Cloud revenue continues to grow at a fast pace, which has helped Alphabet report higher revenue and net income growth rates than Apple. Alphabet also has a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio than Apple.\n\nRead Next: 15 Investments Warren Buffett Regrets\n\nMicrosoft\n\nStock price: $512.14 Market cap: $3.79 trillion\n\nMicrosoft is another competitor to monitor due to its PCs and software. Although Microsoft\u2019s smartphone never caught on and was discontinued in 2017, it has a lead over Apple in artificial intelligence. The tech giant\u2019s big investments in OpenAI and the Microsoft Copilot launch, which took place two years ago, give it a comfortable lead.\n\nMicrosoft is also a leader in the cloud computing industry, but revenue growth has been decelerating in this segment. Investors may want to monitor Microsoft stock, as it has a 33 P/E ratio and decelerating financial growth rates. The stock is also flat over the past year and has \u201conly\u201d gained 121% over the past five years. Microsoft has underperformed the Nasdaq 100 over the past five years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmazon\n\nStock price: $223.48 Market cap: $2.37 trillion\n\nAmazon is another big tech competitor. While Amazon also failed with its smartphone launch, Kindle tablets have been competing with iPad sales. However, the bigger competition comes from AI. Amazon is ahead of Apple in that area and has the world\u2019s most recognizable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services. Amazon has more than 30% of the cloud platform market.\n\nAmazon\u2019s income streams are also more diversified than Apple\u2019s. Amazon gives investors exposure to e-commerce, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, gaming, groceries and other verticals. Amazon makes more revenue than Apple, but Apple reports a higher net income due to better profit margins. Amazon stock is up by 36% over the past year and has rallied by 115% over the past five years.\n\nHuawei\n\nAlthough investors can\u2019t buy Huawei shares, Apple investors should still keep an eye on this Chinese smartphone maker. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, contributing to $67 billion of the company\u2019s $391 billion in total fiscal 2024 revenue. However, revenue from China dipped year-over-year and that trend continued in Q1 during fiscal year 2025.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Apple reported $18.5 billion in revenue from China. That\u2019s down by 11% year-over-year. Huawei and boosted Chinese patriotism are two factors contributing to Apple\u2019s decline in its third-largest market. Other companies like Starbucks and Nike are also losing ground in China.

        "title": "Trump Aims Tariff Double Whammy at Industries, Nations by Aug. 1",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US\u2019s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Mumbai Facelift Is Inspired by 200-Year-Old New York Blueprint Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using \u2018Wellness Checks\u2019 on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\nAdministration officials could release details of Trump\u2019s planned 50% duty on copper in the days before they\u2019re set to take effect Aug. 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. That\u2019s the same date so-called reciprocal levies on products from more than a 100 nations are slated to begin.\n\nTrump said Tuesday he is likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals by month\u2019s end, adding that import taxes on semiconductors could come soon as well.\n\nOne person familiar with the process said after copper, Trump\u2019s team has discussed making announcements on lumber, chips, critical minerals and drugs in that order, though that cadence has not been finalized and may change.\n\nThose would follow existing duties on steel, aluminum, automobiles and car parts. Once fully implemented, all the sectoral tariffs would cover 30% to 70% of a country\u2019s imports, with much of the rest being hit by country-specific charges, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe coming wave of US customs taxes will test the calm in financial markets, where investors mostly see Trump\u2019s tough tariff talk as a negotiating ploy prone to delays and de-escalation rather than a prolonged economic headwind.\n\nAfter investigations that can last about nine months, sectoral duties are being imposed on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It\u2019s seen as stronger legal footing than the emergency powers Trump used for his country levies, which face court challenges and are being assigned in letters to dozens of trading partners without a deal.\n\nThe European Union, Japan, India and others have sought to lower both their reciprocal and sectoral rates. That\u2019s complicating talks, given that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer handles country-based rates, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick oversees tariffs on industries, according to people familiar with the dynamics.\n\nHere\u2019s where tariffs on each industry stand:\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that drug duties would come \u201cprobably at the end of the month, and we\u2019re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we\u2019re going to make it a very high tariff.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nLast month, he said duties on pharmaceuticals could grow as high as 200%. Lutnick said on July 8 that the phase-in period could last up to two years.\n\nA staff draft document has focused levies on between 80 and 90 generic essential medicines, as well as specialty chemicals and precursors, according to a person familiar with it. Those parameters have not been set, however, and the complex nature of the investigation could mean the process could drag out longer, another person said.\n\nLevies on generic medicines that have slim profit margins could hit companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Sandoz Group AG. A broader hit that includes brand-name drugs like Ozempic and Keytruda will weigh on the largest manufacturers, such as Eli Lily & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nChips tariffs are on a \u201csimilar\u201d timeline to drugs and are \u201cactually less complicated,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.\n\nSemiconductors were exempted earlier this year from US tariffs on China to give the administration time to develop separate duties. The wide array of exempted products, including inputs for consumer electronics, suggests a very broad consideration of item that could get hit later.\n\nTech companies, auto manufacturers, boat makers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are among those who have registered complaints over potential levies, according to public comments on the probe, which started in April.\n\nThe charges won\u2019t just hit the chips themselves, but popular products including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. smartphones and laptops. It\u2019s even brought together rivals Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which have all voiced reservations.\n\nCopper\n\nCopper duties are set to include all refined metal as well as semi-finished products used in power grids, data centers and the military, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation that started in March could have an outsize effect on consumer prices, because the metal is in automobiles, homebuilding materials, appliances and many other products. While domestic copper producers competing with foreign suppliers may benefit, US buyers of copper targeted with levies will face higher costs.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s largest copper miners met Thursday in Washington to discuss how best to message the administration on how to boost the domestic industry while also avoiding punitive tariffs that would harm production.\n\nLumber\n\nThe administration\u2019s lumber investigation is proceeding on a separate track from existing duties on the material from Canada \u2014 by far the US\u2019s top source of imports.\n\nThe probe is expected to conclude by summer\u2019s end, trade attorney Luke Meisner said during a Wednesday panel.\n\nMore than a dozen lawmakers have pushed the Commerce Department to implement tariffs of at least 60% on imported wood products, such as cabinets and vanities. Some have urged the administration to tariff cabinets at 100% tariffs.\n\nRepublicans from Alabama, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have written letters to the administration that their home-state manufacturers are threatened by cheap foreign imports. Senator Tommy Tuberville said he expects the administration to fulfill their requests.\n\nCritical Minerals\n\nThe critical minerals investigation has proved difficult, according to people familiar with the process.\n\nThe administration has made several moves to speed domestic mineral extraction and processing in order to reduce dependence on China.\n\nBut in the short term, there is little domestic industry to protect with tariffs. Only one US-based company operates a rare-earth mine and processing operation. America remains reliant on imports and tariffs could create supply crunches.\n\nCommercial Aviation\n\nThe EU is among the economies negotiating with the administration for exemptions from possible tariffs on commercial aircraft and jet engines. The Commerce Department launched its investigation in May, which remains pending.\n\nOthers\n\nThe Commerce Department on Monday launched investigations into drones and polysilicon, a key material for solar panels, setting the stage for tariffs but likely at a later date. The department also started an investigation into medium- and heavy-duty trucks used in shipping in April that is ongoing.\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer A.

But Godongwana played that down, noting it was a relatively recent issue \u201cand in any case I feel that our discussion on the broad number issues affecting global growth have included the range of risk to economic growth, without singling out tariffs.\u201d\n\nThe G-20 communique did note the importance of the World Trade Organization to advance trade issues, while adding that it recognized \u201cthe WTO has challenges and needs meaningful, necessary, and comprehensive reform to improve all its functions.\u201d\n\n\u2018Central Bank Independence\u2019\n\nOfficials also sided with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who Trump has excoriated for opposing him by not lowering interest rates, out of concern the levies could spur inflation.\n\n\u201cCentral banks are strongly committed to ensuring price stability, consistent with their respective mandates, and will continue to adjust their policies in a data-dependent manner,\u201d the communique said. \u201cCentral bank independence is crucial to achieving this goal.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSouth African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago told reporters at a closing press conference that the issue of independence \u201ccame out strongly in the conversation.\u201d\n\nPowell did not attend this G-20, with the Fed being represented by Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.\n\nThe communique also included a prominent reference to \u201cfrequent extreme weather events and natural disasters\u2019 which impact economic growth, financial and price stability.\u201d Climate-change language has been a sticking point with the Trump administration in the past.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent skipped the event in favor of a trip to Japan, but Washington still sent a delegation to represent its interests.\n\n\u2018Major Achievement\u2019\n\nBy imposing trade levies, scorning South Africa\u2019s G-20 motto of \u201csolidarity, equality and sustainability\u201d and pulling billions of dollars in funding for climate finance and international aid, the US is testing a world order that has dominated since the end of World War II.\n\nThat makes achieving a communique all the more impressive, said German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil prior to its adoption.\n\n\u201cThis is a major achievement for the G-20 presidency, which has conducted these negotiations with prudence and skill,\u201d he told reporters at the gathering, at a lush resort on the Indian Ocean near the port city of Durban. Issuing the communique sends \u201ca strong signal in favor of multilateralism,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, tariff uncertainty has dented global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund in April cut its projection for 2025 to 2.8% from a January forecast of 3.3% and IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath, who attended the G-20, said that while financial conditions have improved, vigilance was important.\n\n\u201cWhile we will update our global forecast at the end of July, downside risks continue to dominate the outlook and uncertainty remains high,\u201d she said in a statement as the gathering concluded.\n\nSign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletter, and subscribe to the Next Africa podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Hill, Erica Yokoyama and Fran Wang.\n\n(Updates with comments from IMF\u2019s Gopinath in final paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat the Tough Job Market for New College Grads Says About the Economy How Starbucks\u2019 CEO Plans to Tame the Rush-Hour Free-for-All Godzilla Conquered Japan.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Loop Capital analysts said in a note Friday that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shipped 45 million iPhones in the second quarter of 2025, matching its forecast, as fears over tariffs and aggressive promotions helped offset an otherwise flat global smartphone market.\n\nLoop Capital called the quarter \u201cabout as chaotic as any quarter in recent memory,\u201d citing \u201cmassive demand pull ahead to beat said proposed tariffs\u201d and \u201cexceptionally aggressive pricing programs\u201d that prevented a steeper decline in shipments.\n\n\"Unit shipments globally were 282M, essentially flat with the 283M last year and compared to the 300M shipped in CQ1 2025,\" Loop Capital wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile it may seem like we are taking a victory lap regarding the AAPL shipment number (heck, we are),\u201d the analysts added, acknowledging that the outcome was driven by unexpected factors.\n\nApple \u201cflew iPhones into the USA during the early panicking relative to tariffs,\u201d while also ramping up promotions during China\u2019s month-long 618 shopping festival and launching \u201caggressive U.S. and European giveaways.\u201d\n\nIn China, Apple shipped 9.7 million iPhones, ranking fifth behind Huawei, Vivo, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), and others.\n\nGains were said to have been driven by price cuts \u201cas much as 40%\u201d and Apple\u2019s participation in government subsidy programs.\n\nHowever, Loop questioned the sustainability of such deep discounting amid signs that Chinese consumers are favoring local brands.\n\nWhile all major vendors saw a similar tariff-related pull-ahead, \u201cAAPL was the majority beneficiary from a unit perspective,\u201d Loop said.\n\nThe firm lowered its global smartphone shipment forecasts, trimming 2025 projections to 1.21 billion units, down 2%, and reducing 2026 and 2027 estimates by 3.5% and just under 3%, respectively.\n\nLoop said the global market is recovering from \u201closses (collectively) over the past 7+ years,\u201d driven in part by emerging AI-enabled devices.\n\nRelated articles\n\nAnalyst says iPhone demand propped up by pricing, pull-ahead ahead of tariffs\n\nVictoria's Secret Exposed: The Warning Sign Behind the Stock's 52% Collapse\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia\n\nView Comments",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 18, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL and Apple AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nAlphabet vs. Apple: Which Consumer AI Stock Is the Better Buy Right Now?\n\nAlphabet and Apple are the two most well-known providers of consumer apps marketplaces through Google Pay Store and Apple App Store, respectively. The companies are taking initiatives to infuse artificial intelligence (AI) into their consumer-centric offerings to expand their user base and boost market share.\n\nUnlike enterprises and businesses, individual consumers have been much cautious to adopt AI and generative AI (Gen AI) into their daily lifestyle and routines. Per a Bain & Company December 2024 survey, only 35% of U.S. consumers used Gen AI in comparison to 95% of U.S. and European companies. Concerns around privacy, accuracy and data security have hindered proliferation among individual consumers.\n\nHowever, the scenario seems to have changed in the past six months of 2025. As per a latest report by Menlo Ventures, almost 61% of U.S. adults (survey sample of more than 5,000 U.S. adults) have used AI over the past six months, and nearly 19% have made it a habit to use it on a daily basis. Although monetization remains weak (only 3% paying for premium services among an estimated user base of 1.8 billion), the growing infusion of AI tools into consumer lifestyle that makes users complete their daily routine in a better, faster and cheaper way is expected to boost spending.\n\nAccording to the New Minds, New Markets study by Cognizant in collaboration with Oxford Economics, the 18\u201344-year-old AI enthusiasts will \"command an estimated $4.4 trillion of AI-influenced consumer spending in the U.S. by 2030,\" driven by a rise in income and purchasing power. For the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany, the projection stands at $690 billion, $669 billion, and $539 billion, respectively. Alphabet and Apple are well-poised to cultivate this huge opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, GOOGL or AAPL, which has an edge under the current scenario?\n\nThe Case for GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet's open and cloud-centric approach has been driving the popularity of its applications among consumers. In first-quarter 2025, Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. Google Assistant, now called Gemini, is the #2-ranked general AI assistant in terms of usage (23% share) among all U.S. adults as per Menlo Ventures' survey, beating Apple Siri, which is in the #5 position (16% share).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet's initiatives to deploy AI and infuse AI in Search are driving top-line growth. Search revenues are driven by improving engagement with features like AI Overview, which now has 1.5 billion users per month and is available in more than 15 languages across 140 countries. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview's advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities. Advancements in the latest Gemini models are helping Alphabet to upgrade AI Overviews with easier-to-read responses, breaking down key information and incorporating more visuals directly into responses.\n\nCircle to Search is driving additional Search and is gaining popularity among younger users. Circle to Search, which is currently available on more than 300 million Android devices, is expected to gain further popularity with the addition of AI Mode. Circle to Search can now be used to get instant help during gaming on mobile.\n\nThe Case for AAPL Stock\n\nApple is seeing better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence is available. Apple expanded the availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. At the end of 2025, Apple Intelligence will be available in eight more languages: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional) and Vietnamese.\n\nNew Apple Intelligence features, such as Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji, are noteworthy. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Apple Intelligence is now getting added to Apple Wallet, and users can make purchases with Apple Pay.\n\nHowever, Apple Intelligence continues to lag the \"WoW\" factor, which has been a concern. Delayed and staggered launches are other concerns.\n\nGOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, AAPL's Goes South\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL's 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.56 per share, up 3 cents over the past 60 days, indicating an 18.91% increase over 2024's reported figure.\n\nThe consensus mark for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $7.10 per share over the past 60 days, suggesting 5.19% growth over fiscal 2024.\n\nAlphabet Shares Outperform Apple\n\nShares of Alphabet and Apple have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions, volatility related to higher tariffs and increasing regulatory concerns. Year to date, GOOGL shares have lost 3.3%, outperforming Apple's decline of 16%.\n\nValuation: Alphabet's P/S Ratio is Cheaper Than Apple\n\nIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), Apple shares are trading at 7.52X, higher than Alphabet's 6.41X.\n\nWhile Apple has a Value Score of D, Alphabet carries a Value Score of C, suggesting both shares are overvalued.\n\nHere's Why Alphabet Is a Better Consumer AI Stock Right Now\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from the growing popularity of Gemini, AI Overview and Circle to Search among consumers. Continuous innovation across search, productivity and developer tools is a key catalyst for Alphabet. In comparison, Apple is still playing a catch-up role with Apple Intelligence.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Apple, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren't winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "NEW YORK, July  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in Apple, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nInvestors have until August 19, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Apple securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Tucker v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 5:25-cv-05197.\n\nWhy was Apple Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nApple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of smart-devices and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d). Apple\u2019s software includes a digital personal assistant called \u201cSiri,\u201d which was first introduced in October 2011. The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri\u2019s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nIn truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri\u2019s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime \u201cin the coming year.\u201d On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nThen, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and \u201cdisappointing,\u201d with CNN stating that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday\u2019s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.\u201d On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Apple you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

        "content": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the 10 Buzzing Stocks to Watch as AI Trade Makes a Comeback.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Dan Nathan, who is also the principal of RiskReversal Advisors, talked about a downgrade from Jefferies on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and said the company will face further headwinds in the second half of the year. The analyst appreciated the downgrade:\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s not a lot of catalyst right here. And I think you could say, well, the sentiment\u2019s really bad when you have someone like this guy who\u2019s one of like five sells on the street \u2014 which is kind of weird for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), by the way, that it has five sells. You look at the rest of the Mag 7, I think like 90% of the ratings are buys on all of them. So, you know, kudos to this guy, depending upon where he put it on.Analyst Says Apple (AAPL) Will Have Problems in Second Half of 2025 - \u2018They Still Don\u2019t Have AI Strategy\u2019\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company's revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple's total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far, its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta's $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple's iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe fund maintained an underweight position in Apple throughout the quarter. Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock pulled back during the first quarter, in line with the performance of many other technology stocks, and the company experienced some challenges of its own during the quarter. Apple delayed the release of an AI-upgraded Siri, claiming that the new Siri was taking longer to complete than the company expected, and it should come out later this year. The U.S. Department of Justice also stood firm \u2014 as it did during the prior administration \u2014 in asking a federal judge to block Google from paying Apple and other companies to secure its search engine as a default on smartphones and other devices.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

For decades, Apple's proprietary hardware and software have enabled the Company to consistently provide unmatched user experiences that consumers increasingly rely on a daily basis. Whether Apple \u2013 with their unmatched installed base of over a billion user devices - develops its AI with eager partners or over a slightly longer timeframe than what investors hoped for does not change the Company's core competitive differentiation that comes from years of integrating custom silicon with internal operating system software.\"UBS Keeps $210 Target on Apple (AAPL) \u2014 China Still Key in Supply Chain\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares could be poised for a short-term rally as earnings season approaches, according to Citi, which flagged a potential upside surprise that may trigger a squeeze. The stock remains heavily shorted, but the bank believes improving fundamentals could flip sentiment.\n\n\u201cIntel remains the most popular short but we believe the stock could squeeze higher during earnings given potential upside to EPS,\u201d analyst Christopher Danely said in a Friday note.\n\nCiti cited lower capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenses (opex), along with likely upside from the PC end market\u2014responsible for 60% of Intel\u2019s sales\u2014as key drivers. The bank\u2019s estimates for Q2 are above consensus.\n\nBeyond Intel, Citi offered mixed views across the chip sector ahead of Q2 results. It expects AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to trade higher before its earnings, boosted by investor enthusiasm for AI-related growth.\n\nWhile the Wall Street firm acknowledged that buyside expectations may be too high, it lifted its price target on AMD from $145 to $165 based on sentiment improvements.\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU), on the other hand, may struggle in the near term. Citi warned that the stock could remain weak due to \u201cDRAM price flattening and fears of HBM oversupply.\u201d\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) remains Citi\u2019s top pick heading into earnings, with Danely noting the stock is under-owned.\n\n\u201cWe believe MCHP has the most upside potential to consensus estimates in our coverage,\u201d he wrote, with Citi\u2019s 2026 EPS forecast standing 38% above consensus.\n\nMeanwhile,  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON) could face headwinds despite rising investor interest. Danely flagged ongoing risks in the company\u2019s SiC and China low-end businesses, forecasting flat gross margins for the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe believe the stock could trade lower after earnings due to elevated expectations,\u201d the note said.\n\nCiti also remains cautious on Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), citing secular headwinds and the loss of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a customer, despite the stock being \u201csurprisingly\u201d widely owned.\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) was seen as well-positioned, with enough upside to sustain its momentum, especially on gross margins. Citi\u2019s EPS estimate for TXN is about 10% above consensus for the third quarter.\n\nRelated articles\n\nIntel shares could squeeze higher during earnings, analyst says\n\nVictoria's Secret Exposed: The Warning Sign Behind the Stock's 52% Collapse\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia\n\nView Comments",

A deal with Apple followed a landmark agreement with the Department of Defense. 10 stocks we like better than MP Materials \u203a\n\nShares in rare-earth materials and magnets company MP Materials(NYSE: MP) blasted higher by 33.6% in the week to Friday morning.\n\nWhy MP Materials surged again this week\n\nIt's not hard to see why the stock has surged this year. The ongoing need to secure domestic provision of rare earths and the growing trade conflict with China (the country produces about 70% of global rare-earth elements) is driving the U.S. administration, via the Department of Defense, to enter into a partnership with MP Materials.\n\nThe $400 million investment in stock from the DOD, a $150 million loan, and an agreement to ensure the purchase of magnets produced from a facility that MP Materials will build with the help of committed financing, provide substantive backing to the company's growth plans.\n\nBut that was last week. On Tuesday, MP Materials announced an agreement with Apple, whereby it will pay $500 million (with $200 million prepaid) for rare-earth magnets under a long-term supply agreement. The magnets will be produced at a facility in Texas that MP Materials will expand.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe news sent the stock racing higher, and a public offering of stock worth $500 million on Wednesday received such interest that management raised it to $650 million the next day. This is a company on a roll, but substantive execution and political risk remain over the long term.\n\nShould you buy stock in\u00a0MP Materials right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MP Materials, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MP Materials wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "[TSMC North America headquarters in San Jose, California, USA]\nJHVEPhoto\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]) CFO Wendell Huang said the company sees currency volatility as a \u201cbig uncertainty\u201d to its margins and will continuously review hedging strategies to manage the impact, Bloomberg News reported.\n\n\u201cForeign-exchange rate is something that we cannot control, but there were instances before where it was not in our favor, but we managed to lean on other factors so that we are able to keep our profitability, and that\u2019s what we are planning to do,\u201d said Huang in an interview to Bloomberg on Friday, the report added [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/tsmc-calls-fx-big-uncertainty-vows-constant-review-on-hedging?srnd=phx-technology].\n\nTSM did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.\n\n\u201cWe use different hedging alternatives. The first one is to just simply sell the US dollar in the market spot,\u201d said Huang, according to the report. \u201cWe also use forwards contracts, and we also move part of the cash, the US dollar cash, to an offshore holding company whose financial statements are denominated in the US dollar.\u201d\n\nHuang\u2019s remarks came a day after the global foundry reported record profit in the second quarter with growth [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468215-taiwan-semi-rises-after-q2-profit-surges-60-raises-2025-outlook] of 60% and raised its 2025 revenue growth outlook.\n\nDuring TSM's earnings call Thursday, Huang warned that TSM's third-quarter performance would likely face a bigger hit from a strong Taiwan dollar. Huang had noted [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801885-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript] that with every 1% appreciation of Taiwanese dollar against U.S. dollar will reduce the company's reported NT$ revenue by 1%.\n\nLast month, TSM said it is set to pour $10B in capital into an overseas unit to shore up currency hedging operations, another Bloomberg News report [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/tsmc-prudent-about-spending-with-macro-uncertainties-cfo-says?srnd=phx-technology] added, citing the interview.\n\nIn addition, TSM intends to be prudent about spending this year while expanding globally to meet surging AI chip demand.\n\nTSM \u2014 which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies, including Apple (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]), Nvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]) and AMD (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]) \u2014 is sitting tight for now on plans to set aside a maximum of $42B for capital expenditure this year, Huang told the news agency.\n\nOn Thursday, TSM noted that it will maintain its 2025 capital expenditure budget to be between $38B and $42B.\n\nTSMC plans to spend about $165B to build capacity in Arizona, as part of a global expansion aimed at helping meet future demand for the components used for AI.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Trump administration intends to bring the full chip supply-chain back to the U.S. from Asia.\n\nHuang said it will take years for the U.S. to achieve that. TSM relies on hundreds of partners in Taiwan to supply the raw materials and services needed in chipmaking. TSM has told U.S. officials they need to work on incentivizing and helping smaller suppliers on several issues, including permits and talent, Huang noted according to the report.\n\n\u201cIt takes Taiwan a few decades to build up this whole ecosystem. It will take a long time to build that kind of ecosystem in the US,\u201d said Huang, the report added.\n\nHuang said the company\u2019s second facility in Arizona could begin volume production by 2027, advancing its schedule in by several quarters. TSM could also speed up construction of a third facility due to customer demand. The company thinks that about 30% of its 2-nanometer or more advanced capacity would be located in Arizona eventually, the report noted.\n\n\"We are mindful about macro uncertainties these days, primarily related to tariff policies, so we are being prudent about planning our capex,\u201d said Huang.\n\nMORE ON TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING\n\n \t* TSMC: Growth Moderation Ahead, But Still A Buy (Rating Downgrade) [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802090-tsmc-growth-moderation-ahead-but-still-a-buy-rating-downgrade]\n \t* TSMC Q2: AI Growth Is Booming, Yet I'm Holding Off [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802071-tsmc-q2-ai-growth-is-booming-yet-im-holding-off]\n \t* TSMC: The Bull Run Has Only Just Begun [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802054-tsmc-the-bull-run-has-only-just-begun]\n \t* TSMC's Q2 results signify strong AI demand, but analysts point to implied Q4 conservatism [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468385-tsmcs-q2-results-signify-strong-ai-demand-but-analysts-point-to-implied-q4-conservatism]\n \t* Taiwan Semi rises after Q2 profit surges 60%, raises 2025 outlook [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468215-taiwan-semi-rises-after-q2-profit-surges-60-raises-2025-outlook]\n\n ",

        "content": "We recently published 10 Stocks On Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar As He Says Trump Has Been Good For Growth. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world\u2019s largest consumer electronics firm, has had a rough 2025 as the shares have lost 13.6% year-to-date. The weakness in the share price has caught Cramer\u2019s attention. The CNBC TV host believes that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to make an AI acquisition to catch up with rivals. Yet, he also believes that talk about CEO Tim Cook\u2019s resignation is premature. Cramer believes that a potential Cook successor should be hardware-focused. This time, he discussed what the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO might have to do in order to achieve the same clout at the White House as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang:\n\n\u201c[On what would it take for Cook to have the same clout with Trump as Huang] Well you know what\u2019s funny, they have the MP Materials deal today. Put in 500 million dollars. . .This is for recycled metals. But Tim Cook has to do, and I feel bad telling Tim Cook, like who am I, sorry Tim. But what he has to do he has to spend that 500 billion over four years. He has to front load it. He has to say, listen, I\u2019m committing a 100 billion right now in Montana and what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re gonna have the largest, we\u2019re gonna have the largest part of the cellphone ever right here. And then, you know what the President would do, the President would say I never want to see a Samsung phone, ever.\u201dApple Inc. (AAPL) Has To Spend Money To Win Over President Trump, Says Jim Cramer\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nPreviously, the CNBC TV host discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s CEO in detail:\n\n\u201c[On analysts saying Tim Cook should leave] I wanted to say, I thought it was outrageous. I thought that was outrageous. I wish that I could\u2019ve, that I would love to be able to be Tim Cook and say what I\u2019ve done for the shareholders. And it\u2019s just incredible. The amount of wealth that man has created. I mean that\u2019s like when I saw, at one point today I saw in premarket that NVIDIA was down. I was going to call for Jensen\u2019s firing. . .I mean come on. . .you know Jensen has to go. Can we like stop? Like stop? Like Tim Cook\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

This outlook isn't exactly bringing in growth-minded investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, 49% of total revenue came from the iPhone, a product that's 18 years into its life cycle. While this might be the most successful product of all time, its maturity these days doesn't really incentivize consumers to constantly buy the newest upgrades. To be fair, Apple's other products are incredibly popular, but it's hard to drive meaningful growth on a very high sales base.\n\nThere have been concerns that Apple's entrance into artificial intelligence (AI) has been slow. The new and improved AI-powered Siri isn't expected to be launched until 2026.\n\nAnd it seems that observers are constantly hearing about new AI developments from big tech peers. For what it's worth, though, Apple's focus on the user experience and privacy are always bright spots.\n\nInvestors can't forget about the dynamic tariff situation.

        "content": "[Rear view of graphic designers working in a computer software company.]\nskynesher/E+ via Getty Images\n\nGlobal PC shipments rose 8.4% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025\u2014the strongest annual growth since 2022\u2014driven by recovering demand and improved supply chains, according to preliminary estimates from Counterpoint Research.\n\nLenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNVGY]), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]), and Asus each saw over 10% year-on-year shipment growth, outperforming other brands and further consolidating their worldwide market dominance.\n\nYet, the global PC manufacturing footprint remains heavily concentrated in China, posing significant challenges for the industry in mitigating tariff risks in the near term.\n\n\"Due to uncertainty related to the US tariff policy, many OEMs are currently in a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 mode, and OEMs are adjusting their manufacturing locations as tariff concerns continue to loom. These restrictions and supply chain reallocations are expected to be a hurdle for PC shipments in 2025, the research noted.\n\n\u201cThe tariff policy roller coaster will likely cause consumers and enterprises to pause their AI PC purchases in 2025, which in turn will suppress growth for this segment. The lingering global economic uncertainty also poses a downside risk to our 2025 PC shipment forecast of low-single-digit YoY percentage growth,\u201d Associate Director David Naranjo said.\n\nThe ongoing diversification [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793615-laptop-makers-sellers-emphasize-tactical-tariff-actions] of production bases, according to Counterpoint Research, reflects an industry-wide strategy to minimize exposure to trade disruptions while ensuring supply chain resilience.\n\nAs such, a key focus is on transitioning manufacturing for US-bound goods to facilities located outside China.\n\nIn conclusion, as tariff and trade uncertainties linger, the global PC industry continues to focus on diversifying its production footprint to ensure stability and adaptability.\n\n\"With AI laptops projected to become a mainstream standard by 2026, vendors who invest early in competitive pricing and ecosystem readiness will likely gain an edge in the next wave of PC upgrades.\"\n\nMORE ON MICROSOFT, APPLE, ETC.\n\n \t* Why Microsoft Still Has Room [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801869-why-microsoft-still-has-room]\n \t* Apple Is A Value Stock Not A Growth Stock [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801776-apple-value-stock-not-growth-stock]\n \t* Why Every AI Agent Will Likely Run On Microsoft [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800912-why-every-ai-agent-will-likely-run-on-microsoft]\n \t* OpenAI launches ChatGPT agent to carry out tasks [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468751-openai-launches-chatgpt-agent-to-carry-out-tasks]\n \t* Trump administration said to be preparing executive order targeting 'woke' AI [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4468734-trump-administration-preparing-executive-order-woke-ai]\n\n ",

        "title": "Why Affirm Could Be the Sleeper Fintech of the Decade",
        "content": "After years of being dismissed as a money-losing BNPL experiment, Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) just posted its first GAAP profit, grew GMV 36% year-over-year, and added 1.8 million new customers in a single quarter. It's scaling a two-sided network across Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP), and now Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) while moving closer to sustained profitability. Yet the market still seems anchored to its past. At 31 forward earnings and a PEG of just 0.31, Affirm may be quietly becoming one of the most overlooked growth stories in fintech.\n\n1. An Innovative \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" Business\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AFRM.\n\nAffirm is reinventing how consumers pay. Through its Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) model, Affirm lets users split purchases into installment payments. No late fees. No hidden charges. Just simple, transparent credit at the point of sale. It's a payments platform, not a bank. Its revenue comes from two engines: merchant fees (retailers pay to boost conversion and basket size) and interest on consumer loans (on non-0% APR plans). With 21.9 million active users, $8.6 billion in GMV, and 358,000 merchants as of third quarter 2025, Affirm is scaling a two-sided network that benefits both sides of the checkout.\n\nUnit economics are promising: roughly 43% gross margin (\"revenue less transaction costs\" was $994M on $2.3B revenue in FY2024). And it's growing fast. In the most recent quarter, Affirm's GMV reached $8.6 billion, marking a 36% year-over-year increasedriven in part by a standout March, which grew nearly 40%. The platform added 1.8 million new consumers while sustaining a 94% repeat usage rate, underscoring both healthy user acquisition and strong engagement from existing customers.\n\n2. A Moat That's Forming, Not Yet Fortified\n\nAffirm isn't without competition. Klarna, Afterpay (Block (NYSE:XYZ)), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and even Apple have dabbled in BNPL. But Apple shut down its own offering in 2024 and chose to integrate Affirm directly into Apple Pay. That's a powerful endorsement.\n\nSo what's the moat?\n\nNetwork Effects: Affirm's app drives demand back to merchants, and merchant scale drives user adoption. But the flywheel isn't as tight as Visa's yet. Brand & Trust: Affirm wins with transparency. No junk fees. No revolving debt. Their NPS was 78 back in 2020, and consumers increasingly prefer set payoff terms over credit card traps. Technology & Underwriting: Their secret sauce? Superior data and machine learning to price risk and approve credit better than peers. Scale & Distribution: Exclusive partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, along with new integration into Apple Pay, position Affirm as a leading BNPL provider across major digital ecosystems.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe moat is real, but still being dug. It's not unbreachable.\n\n3. Owner-Led, Long-Term Aligned Management\n\nFounder Max Levchin (ex-PayPal Mafia) owns a significant stake and hasn't sold a single share since IPO. He's the visionary, and Affirm's culture mirrors his owner-operator mindset. After a turbulent FY2023, Levchin refocused the business on profitability over pure growth. Layoffs were made, spending tightened, and the company delivered its first GAAP profit in Q2 FY2025.\n\nThat internal discipline has started to reflect externally. While Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) has been trimming its stake likely part of its broader rotation out of fintech other heavyweight investors are leaning in. Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio)'s Gotham Asset Management has been adding to its position, alongside Jefferies and Renaissance Technologies (Trades, Portfolio). That's notable. Greenblatt, known for his disciplined, fundamentals-based approach, tends to pick stocks when value disconnects from business quality. Renaissance, one of the most sophisticated quant hedge funds in the world, also upped its bet suggesting Affirm's signals look strong across both discretionary and systematic lenses.\n\nIn other words: insiders are holding, and smart money is circling.\n\nThe company's capital allocation is rational:\n\nRepurchased convertible debt at deep discounts. Raised $750M in long-term notes while planning up to $300M in equity buybacks. Avoided reckless M&A, exiting non-core Returnly.\n\n4. Financials Improving, and the TAM Is Still Massive\n\nAffirm grew revenue 4.5 in four years, from over $500 million in 2020 to $2.32B in 2024. FY2025 guidance is $3.17B a 36% YoY growth rate. RLTC margin remains healthy, and operating income is turning positive. The path to GAAP operating profitability looks real.\n\nThe global BNPL market is still in its early innings and Affirm is positioned right in the middle of it. According to recent projections, global BNPL payments are expected to grow 13.7% year-over-year to reach $560.1 billion in 2025. From 2021 to 2024, the sector grew at a blistering 21.7% CAGR and while the pace moderates, the expansion doesn't stop. Analysts now forecast a 10.2% CAGR through 2030, which would bring the market from $492.8 billion in 2024 to $911.8 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nThat's a near-doubling in six years without factoring in additional digital payment tailwinds.\n\nSo the runway is still long. Affirm has 21.9 million active users solid, but modest compared to Klarna's 150 million and PayPal's 436 million. It doesn't need to catch up to win even modest share gains in point-of-sale credit or U.S. consumer spending could drive billions in incremental GMV.\n\nAffirm is also riding a generational shift. Gen Z and millennials are ditching revolving debt in favor of budgeting tools and installment plans. Affirm's transparency, zero late fees, and set payoff terms align perfectly. And now, with Apple Pay integration, its top-of-funnel reach just expanded dramatically.\n\nStill, it's early days. Net income was still negative in FY2024 (-$518M), though Q2 FY25 showed $80M in profit. If margins stabilize and revenue grows 20% annually in the next ten years, its total revenue could reach $19.6 billion. With a 10% net margin, Affirm could hit nearly $2 billion in net income by 2035. Free cash flow will follow if they continue selling off loans via partners (vs. holding on balance sheet). Their Sixth Street $4B facility is key it proves capital markets trust Affirm's underwriting.\n\nBalance sheet? Reasonable. ~$2.87B equity on $10.4B assets, and most liabilities fund loans. Risk is concentrated in credit quality, not leverage.\n\n5. Valuation: Where's the Margin of Safety?\n\nAffirm is currently valued at nearly $20 billion market capitalization. That's ~5 sales and >31 forward earnings.\n\nAffirm might just be the most mispriced growth story in fintech right now. The company trades at 31 forward earnings, which isn't cheapuntil you factor in earnings growth. With EPS expected to surge 101%, its PEG ratio drops to just 0.31. That level of valuation relative to growth is uncommon in today's market. Especially in a market that's starting to reward profitable growth again. For context, anything under 1 is considered undervalued. Under 0.5? You're likely staring at an asymmetric bet that the market hasn't woken up to yet.Why Affirm Could Be the Sleeper Fintech of the Decade\n\nLet's compare. Shopify's PEG ratio clocks in at 4.43rich, even for a company with its brand and reach. PayPal and Shift4 (NYSE:FOUR) look more reasonably priced with PEGs of 1.50 and 0.83, but neither matches Affirm's combination of growth velocity and margin expansion. In other words, Affirm's valuation isn't just compellingit's in a league of its own. The company just posted its first GAAP profit, added 1.8M new customers in a single quarter, and continues to ride tailwinds from major partners like Amazon and Apple.\n\nThis isn't speculation. It's execution. The same business that Wall Street labeled unprofitable 12 months ago is now turning the cornerfast. Investors betting against it are anchoring to last year's headlines, not this year's numbers. With Affirm firing on both the top and bottom line, the PEG tells a clear story: if the company keeps compounding like this, today's price will look like a gift.\n\n6. What Could Go Wrong?\n\nAffirm's upside is real but so is the risk. This is still a credit business at the core, and if the consumer weakens or delinquencies spike, growth could stall fast. Rising unemployment? Higher charge-offs. A soft holiday season? GMV slows. And while Affirm isn't a bank, it still depends on capital markets to fund and offload loans. If rates stay elevated or credit spreads blow out, that $4B Sixth Street facility starts looking more expensive or less reliable.\n\nThere's also the regulatory wildcard. Buy Now, Pay Later has drawn attention from the CFPB and other global regulators. If new disclosure rules, fee restrictions, or capital requirements hit the space, Affirm's margin profile could change overnight.\n\nBut that pressure cuts both ways. As Affirm's loan book matures and delinquencies naturally rise, the true test will be how well its underwriting models hold up in a tougher macro backdrop. The recent CFPB move to classify BNPL as a credit card product with tighter disclosure, dispute resolution rules, and data reporting. That raises costs but it also raises the bar for new entrants. Once those compliance systems are in place, the marginal cost of staying compliant is relatively fixed. And that turns regulation from a risk into a moat.\n\nEven distribution isn't bulletproof. Sure, Apple Pay is a huge win. But Apple has a long history of cozying up before competing. If they reverse course or cut Affirm out, the moat starts to look more like a drawbridge.\n\nBottom line? Execution matters. The path to $2B in earnings by 2035 isn't guaranteed. If underwriting slips, consumer behavior shifts, or macro turns against them, the bull case fades fast.\n\nBottom line\n\nAffirm isn't without risk credit exposure, funding reliance, and regulatory scrutiny all loom large. But the fundamentals are shifting. Profitability is no longer theoretical. User growth remains strong. And its valuation, while not cheap on traditional metrics, looks increasingly attractive when paired with execution and earnings velocity. If Affirm continues to scale smartly, manage risk, and maintain discipline, the current price may end up being less of a bet and more of a mispricing.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "title": "Apple's SWOT analysis: stock resilience amid AI push and regulatory hurdles",
        "content": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., the tech giant known for its innovative products and services, continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges. As of July 18, 2025, the company maintains its position as a prominent player in the Technology Hardware sector, with a substantial market capitalization of $3.14 trillion and trailing twelve-month revenue of $400.37 billion. According to InvestingPro\u2019s analysis, Apple\u2019s overall financial health score stands at \"GOOD,\" reflecting its strong market position despite facing regulatory pressures, competitive threats, and technological shifts. This comprehensive analysis examines Apple\u2019s current standing, future prospects, and the factors influencing its stock performance.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nApple\u2019s financial performance remains robust, with analysts projecting steady growth in both revenue and earnings per share (EPS). For fiscal year 2025, revenue estimates range from $402 billion to $408 billion, representing a modest increase from the previous year. EPS projections for FY2025 vary among analysts, with estimates ranging from $6.96 to $7.22. InvestingPro analysis indicates that Apple currently trades above its Fair Value, with a P/E ratio of 32.82 and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 22.34. The company has demonstrated consistent shareholder returns, maintaining dividend payments for 14 consecutive years while aggressively buying back shares.\n\nWant deeper insights? InvestingPro subscribers get access to over 10 additional exclusive tips and comprehensive financial metrics for AAPL, helping investors make more informed decisions.\n\nThe company\u2019s App Store continues to be a significant revenue driver, despite ongoing legal challenges. In May 2025, App Store revenue grew by 13%, with notable growth in entertainment (+21%) and music (+20%) categories. This growth persists even as Apple faces potential changes to its App Store fee structure due to legal rulings.\n\nProduct and Service Overview\n\niPhone sales remain a crucial component of Apple\u2019s business, though growth has moderated. Analysts note that the smartphone user base age is at an all-time high, indicating a maturing market. Despite this, Apple has seen strong performance in other product categories, with iPad sales growing 15.2% year-over-year in a recent quarter, and Mac sales increasing across all geographic segments.\n\nThe Services segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, continues to be a high-margin, recurring revenue stream for the company. However, some analysts have observed a slight deceleration in Services growth due to foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nAI Strategy and Developments\n\nApple\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) strategy has become a focal point for investors and analysts. The company is reportedly working on enhancing Siri with more personalized features, though some of these improvements may not be released until 2026. Apple is also exploring partnerships with AI companies like Anthropic and potentially Gemini to bolster its AI capabilities.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to unveil new AI-enabled features in upcoming software updates, including live translation for AirPods, AI-powered battery management, and enhanced accessibility features. The company\u2019s \"full stack\" approach, combining hardware and software development, is seen as a potential advantage in the emerging era of personal AI server devices.\n\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nApple faces several regulatory hurdles that could impact its business model. The ongoing litigation with Epic Games regarding App Store fees remains a concern, with potential implications for Apple\u2019s ability to charge fees on third-party transactions within the App Store. Additionally, a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) threatens the lucrative payments Apple receives for making Google the default search engine on its devices.\n\nThe company is also grappling with potential tariffs on iPhones imported from India, which could affect profit margins. However, analysts suggest that Apple is unlikely to shift production to the United States due to high costs and long time-to-market considerations.\n\nMarket Position and Competition\n\nWhile Apple maintains a strong position in the global smartphone market, it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers. These competitors now constitute approximately half of the smartphone market, intensifying the competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Apple\u2019s financial metrics remain impressive, with a return on equity of 138% and a gross profit margin of 46.63%. The company\u2019s strong balance sheet shows an Altman Z-Score of 9.44, indicating robust financial health, though InvestingPro data reveals that short-term obligations currently exceed liquid assets with a current ratio of 0.82.\n\nApple\u2019s ecosystem of products and services continues to be a key differentiator, with the company leveraging its integrated approach to enhance user experience and loyalty. However, the benefits gained from COVID-related demand and Huawei\u2019s market exit are diminishing, potentially impacting future growth prospects.\n\nBear Case\n\nHow might increased regulatory scrutiny impact Apple\u2019s App Store revenue?\n\nThe App Store faces significant regulatory challenges that could affect its revenue model. The ongoing litigation with Epic Games and potential rulings requiring Apple to allow third-party payment options within apps could reduce the company\u2019s ability to collect fees on transactions. Some analysts estimate that up to 28% of US iPhone users might circumvent the App Store\u2019s In-App Purchase system if given the option, potentially impacting Apple\u2019s earnings per share by about 2%.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google threatens the substantial payments Apple receives for making Google the default search engine on its devices. These payments, estimated at $20-$24 billion annually, contribute significantly to Apple\u2019s Services revenue. A negative outcome in this case could result in a material impact on Apple\u2019s earnings.\n\nWhat are the potential consequences of rising competition in the smartphone market?\n\nThe smartphone market has become increasingly saturated, with the average user base age at an all-time high. This maturity limits opportunities for new sales growth. Additionally, Chinese smartphone manufacturers have captured a significant market share, now constituting approximately half of the global market. This increased competition puts pressure on Apple\u2019s margins and market share, potentially leading to slower growth in its core iPhone business.\n\nMoreover, the benefits Apple gained from COVID-related demand and Huawei\u2019s market exit are diminishing. As these tailwinds subside, Apple may face challenges in maintaining its current growth rates in the smartphone segment, which remains a crucial part of its overall business.\n\nBull Case\n\nHow could Apple\u2019s AI strategy drive future growth and innovation?\n\nApple\u2019s focus on AI integration across its product lineup presents significant opportunities for growth and innovation. The company\u2019s \"full stack\" approach, combining hardware and software development, positions it well in the emerging era of personal AI server devices. By enhancing Siri with more personalized features and exploring partnerships with leading AI companies, Apple could differentiate its products and services in a meaningful way.\n\nThe integration of AI into Apple\u2019s ecosystem could lead to new revenue streams and increased user engagement. For example, AI-powered features like live translation for AirPods, enhanced battery management, and improved accessibility options could attract new customers and encourage existing users to upgrade their devices more frequently. Additionally, Apple\u2019s strong focus on privacy and on-device processing could give it a competitive advantage in AI implementation, appealing to privacy-conscious consumers.\n\nWhat opportunities exist for Apple to expand its Services segment?\n\nDespite some regulatory challenges, Apple\u2019s Services segment continues to show strong growth potential. The App Store has demonstrated resilience, with revenue growing 13% in May 2025 despite legal pressures. This suggests that developers and consumers continue to value the platform\u2019s convenience and security.\n\nApple has opportunities to expand its Services offerings beyond the App Store. The company could leverage its large user base to introduce new subscription-based services or expand existing ones like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and iCloud. Additionally, as AI becomes more prevalent, Apple could develop new AI-driven services that capitalize on its hardware-software integration, potentially creating new revenue streams that are less dependent on device sales.\n\nFurthermore, Apple\u2019s strong brand and customer loyalty provide a solid foundation for introducing innovative financial services or expanding its Apple Pay ecosystem, which could contribute significantly to Services revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\nStrong brand recognition and customer loyaltyIntegrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and servicesRobust financial position with consistent revenue and earnings growthHigh-margin Services segment with recurring revenue streamsFocus on privacy and security, differentiating from competitors\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on iPhone sales for a significant portion of revenueRegulatory challenges affecting App Store and Google search payment modelsDelayed implementation of certain AI features compared to competitorsExposure to supply chain disruptions and potential tariffs\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion of AI capabilities across product lineupGrowth potential in Services segment, including new AI-driven offeringsExploration of new product categories (e.g., augmented reality devices)Expansion in emerging markets with growing middle-class populationsLeveraging strong cash position for strategic acquisitions or partnerships\n\nThreats\n\nIncreasing regulatory scrutiny and potential fines or restrictionsRising competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturersPotential disruption of the Google search payment model due to legal challengesMacroeconomic uncertainties affecting consumer spending on premium devicesRapid technological changes requiring constant innovation to maintain market position\n\nAnalysts Targets\n\nEvercore ISI (July 8, 2025): $250.00Barclays (July 9, 2025): $173.00JMP Securities (July 14, 2025): No Change (NC)Jefferies (July 1, 2025): $188.32J.P.
